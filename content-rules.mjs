// content-rules.mjs — the standing rules the ant-swarm preserves for hard
// content types, so future sessions handle that type immediately instead of
// re-deriving the read from scratch.
//
// The preserve-half of the protocol ("preserve rules for that type of content
// globally moving forward"): every time a turn swarms on hard meaning and the
// swarm converges (or fails in a way that is a property of the content TYPE),
// the surviving read is written here as a standing rule for that type — keyed
// by the signal that made meaning hard (hard-meaning.mjs's `type`), carrying
// the falsifying control that would concede it (the wall II.23). The next
// turn pointed at the same type reads the ledger first and applies the rule
// without re-deriving: the ant-swarm becomes literate about its own material.
//
// Persistence mirrors heimdall-derived-rules.json exactly (append-only JSON
// map, save swallows failure, a recurring type never re-writes every turn).
// This file lives beside swarm-server.mjs; the proxy serves it as
// GET /content-rules so every surface attached to eoreader7 reads the same
// standing rules.
