// 1. THE CONVERSATION FOLD IS NOT A SOURCE. The reading folds the turn's

//    hand that folded text straight back as though it were a
//    corroborating passage — found live: a segment carrying the task's

//    against the task directly (the honest, convention-agnostic signal)
//    rather than pattern-matching a fold-id naming scheme this file has
//    no declared knowledge of.
//
// 2. AN UNNAMED SOURCE IS NOT THE SAME UNNAMED SOURCE — but a duplicate
//    fragment of an ALREADY-NAMED source is not a new one either. Some
//    field-recalled segments carry no `_ledger.source` at all (a real gap
//    upstream, in whatever admits chunks into the field — not fixed
//    here, disclosed); the field's own recall frequently just re-hands
//    back a sentence that is ALREADY present, verbatim, inside a whole
//    document this same surf already addressed by name (found live: two
//    of three "unlabeled" fragments were each the exact final sentence of
//    the wire-service and port-authority documents, which were ALSO
//    present in full as their own named records — double-counting the
//    same content as if it were two additional, distinct, unidentified
//    sources on top of the two real ones). Every unnamed fragment is
//    first checked against every already-named record's own text; a
//    verbatim match is dropped (its content already counts, once, under
//    the name it actually has) rather than either collapsing to a shared
//    "unlabeled" (undercounting real distinctness) or getting its own
//    synthetic ref regardless (overcounting it). Only a fragment that
//    matches NO named record's text — a genuine glimpse of an otherwise-
