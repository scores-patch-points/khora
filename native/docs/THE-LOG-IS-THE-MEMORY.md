# The log is the memory; objects condense on demand

A design note, 2026-09-06, written from measurements rather than from
intention. It records why the reader's memory footprint is what it is, what
the log already makes possible, and the one architectural change that closes
the gap.

## The finding

**The fold holds nothing the log lacks.** Reconstructed from the log alone,
it comes back byte-identical:

```
log:   4,879 entries, 7.3 MB JSON, 490 KB gzipped
fold: 15,235 entries, 10.4 MB JSON  — held resident

REBUILT from the log alone: 15,235 entries in 101 ms
  identical to the live fold? YES   4c580f8a95189b90 vs 4c580f8a95189b90
```

Everything the reader keeps in memory is a **cache of a projection**, and the
projection is exact. The machinery defending that cache — `structuredClone`
on every upsert, the DELTA chain, one array version per encounter — is all
work spent maintaining something the log can regenerate in a tenth of a
second.

## What is actually being stored

For one 300-character sentence, 13 graph entries totalling 8,262 bytes — a
**28× expansion**:

| count | schema | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| 6 | `EOReferentOccurrence@1` | one per mention of a person or thing |
| 3 | `EOLexicalOccurrence@1` | one per noun, with POS tag and offset |
| 3 | `EOOperation@1` | the reader's own actions, as an audit trail |
| 1 | `Observation@1` | 2,682 bytes — the whole perception record |

Across 120 KB of text (1,707 sentences), three multipliers compound:

| stage | size | ×previous |
|---|---|---|
| the text | 120 KB | — |
| records, gzipped | 554 KB | 4.6× — *the information content* |
| records, as JSON | 10.6 MB | **19×** field redundancy |
| as live JS objects | ~340 MB | **32×** object overhead and array versions |

## Three distinct problems, and only one of them is encoding

**1. The same content is stored two and three times.** Of the 6,637 objects
nested inside `Observation@1` entries, **100%** are also stored as top-level
fold entries. The log holds the same 1,465 observations again. Occurrences
appear both in `Observation.graphEntries` (737) and in `DeltaFold` operation
payloads (1,087), for 1,808 distinct entries. A binary encoding would give
three smaller copies; the fix is a reference where an object is nested.

**2. Field redundancy, which is where a columnar or interned encoding wins.**
`"schema":"EOReferentOccurrence@1"` is written 3,908 times; `provenance`
holds **2 distinct values** across 3,908 entries; `standing` holds **1**. That
is most of the 19×.

**3. Versioning.** One array version per encounter, each a full copy, because
each fold snapshot must be immutable. Binary only fixes this if it makes the
store append to a buffer instead of copying an array — which is the
structural change doing the work, not the bytes.

## What the log already makes possible

An object need not exist until something asks for it. Measured, same read:

| query | cost | materialised |
|---|---|---|
| reconstruct everything | 143 ms | 15,235 entries |
| everything about "the vicomte" | **1.8 ms** | 69 occurrences |
| about "the prince" | 0.9 ms | 25 |
| about "the emperor" | 0.7 ms | 21 |

And the same query asked **at a cursor** — which is what makes this the right
architecture rather than merely a cheaper one:

| "the vicomte" as of | cost | occurrences |
|---|---|---|
| 25% of the reading | 0.1 ms | **0** |
| 50% | 0.2 ms | 25 |
| 75% | 0.3 ms | 34 |
| 100% | 0.2 ms | 34 |

The referent does not exist at 25%. It is not that it is hidden or empty — the
reading had not yet met it. `hypergraph-projection.js` already states this
principle in its own header — *"identity is retrieval-time — P1 — so a node
at cursor 500 may be two nodes at cursor 200"* — and the fold then
materialises everything eagerly, as though identity were storage-time. The
declared principle and the implementation disagree, and the implementation is
the one costing 340 MB.

*The wheel names this register once (`native/docs/THE-WHEEL.md`, canonical):
the referent born at first admission is a **Being** — the spokes, "a being is
the fold at a point"; the fold this document rebuilds from the log is the
**Fold** — the rim, the pattern; the ground it is read against is the
**Void** — the hub. This document cites the wheel's naming, never re-derives
it.*

## The change

**Resident: the log.** Append-only, immutable, 7.3 MB as JSON and 490 KB
compressed — and it is the only thing that has to be true.

**On demand: whatever the question needs.** A query walks the log at its
cursor and condenses only the objects it is about. Under 2 ms for a
substantial referent; a tenth of a millisecond for a narrow one at an early
cursor.

**Not retained: everything else.** No `structuredClone`, no array versions, no
DELTA chain — all three exist to keep an immutable cache coherent, and a
cache that can be rebuilt exactly in 101 ms does not need to be immutable.

This is how recall works rather than how a database works: the trace is kept,
and the object is reassembled when something reaches for it.

## What must not be lost

- **Exactness.** `native/eval/read-cost.mjs --identity` hashes the log and the
  projection's nodes and links at four cursors. A change that alters any of
  them has changed the reading, whatever it did to the clock. Expected on an
  unchanged read path: `logHash bcf5d8196b69d8f0` (was `45bbbbbd578d027f`
  until P165 put the merge record into the log), 926 sentences, 2,691 log
  entries, 38 nodes and 166 links at the final cursor.
- **The cursor.** A query must be answerable *as of* a point in the reading,
  or retrieval-time identity is lost and with it the ability to see that a
  node at 100% was two nodes at 25%.
- **The incremental path.** P157 fixed two places where a chainView was
  reachable in principle and never hit in practice. Any query layer must be
  measured for hit rate, not assumed to have one — the last one measured
  **zero hits in 3,392 calls** while looking correct.

## The array copy (P166)

The last resident term. `upsertManyById` copied the whole array on every
call and the delta record pointed backward, so the tip held every
intermediate array alive: the O(n²) was memory, not only time. On the old
code a full book dies at an 8 GB heap after 300 s; so does 1 MB.

Now an array the fold created is owned and extended in place; the delta
stream points forward and retains nothing behind the views; a superseded
turn's `fold` is the log's projection at its seq, reconstructed on demand.
Transience is declared by the chain's owner (`{ transient: true }` in
`reading.js` and `reconstruct`) — `applyObservation`/`applyDelta` stay pure
by default, because `tests/identity-revision.test.js` holds an earlier fold
and reads it after the next delta, and that is a legitimate thing to do with
a pure function.

Measured, old and new back-to-back under the same load (the P145 arm's
model calls beside both; the heap column is per-process):

```
 sentences   old s   new s   old heap MB   new heap MB
       926    1.56    3.9          160            77
      1707    8.27    3.45         413           173
      3051   33.35   33.28        1482           421
```

**The copy was the memory term, not the time term.** Heap 3.5× lower at
3,051 sentences; read time unchanged. The remaining super-linear time is
elsewhere — the per-refresh re-clustering in `discoverReferents`, the
neighbourhood walks — and is the next thing to measure, not to assume.

Gates on the final code: `--identity` at 60 KB unchanged; `--trace
--against` byte-identical at all 123 sampled steps (240 KB) and all 120
(480 KB), baselines from a clean worktree of the previous HEAD.

**The full book, on the new code** (`--projection-identity --bytes 3300000`,
War and Peace, run beside the P145 arm's model calls):

```
sentences        34,229        log entries    98,940
read             9,801 s       heap           3,590 MB
fold entries    286,642        reconstruct(log) hash == live entry hash: YES
                               (6fcb505f24492f60 at cursor 100%)
cursors  25%: 219 nodes / 7,149 links   50%: 347 / 17,932
         75%: 531 / 30,353              100%: 658 / 43,633
```

It completes, where the old code died at 8 GB after 300 s, and the
reconstruction is exact at this scale. And it is slow: 286 ms/sentence
against ~11 at 3,051 sentences under the same load — the super-linear TIME
term is the next problem, and it is not the copy.

## The time term (P167)

Closed by growth ranking: profile the same read at two sizes, rank inclusive
time by its growth ratio, fix the term whose share grows, gate against the
old code byte-for-byte, re-profile. Nine terms in six commits; the ladder
and each term are in the-fold POLICIES.md P167.

```
                    120->240 KB growth      240->480 KB growth
before                 5.09x  (1.79x sent.)      12.5x  (2x sent.)
after                  1.82x                       3.9x
480 KB read, CPU-sampled beside the arm:  79.3 s -> 25.0 s
```

Wall-clock, old (0bcb90d) and final (6c40ab5) back to back:

```
 sentences   old s   new s   old heap   new heap
       926    1.66    0.86     130 MB      81 MB
      1707    6.98    2.54     411 MB     151 MB
      3051   14.81    4.65    1404 MB     338 MB
      5904     OOM   13.57         —      486 MB
```

The full book on the final code: 34,229 sentences in **627 s** (9,801 s on
the P166 code), reconstruct(log) hash 6fcb505f24492f60 — identical to the
P166 run's, so the whole-book reading is unchanged byte-for-byte. Heap
4,437 MB (3,590 MB then): the indexes and view states that replaced the
scans are resident, and that is the next memory term.

Two of this pass's own cuts were refused by the differential before they
landed — `changedOnly` offering only the extras (the LOG hash moved, the
nodes held), and fold steps applying `updated` before `appended` (an index
left on a stale canonical at step 5534) — which is what the gate is for.
