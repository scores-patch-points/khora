// the legacy engine · perceiver/audio — real PCM in, per-frame material out.
// Decodes with the system ffmpeg (no bundled decoder, no synthetic waveform).
// See perceiver/text/material.js for the shared load/reduce contract.
//
// TWO CHANNELS, not one reduction replacing another — the same shape as
// csv's `column` option and activation-clearings.mjs's four named channels
// over text, and the discipline conformance/perceiver_invariance.test.js's
// own header states: a gap closes by ADDING a statistic sensitive to what the
// old one missed, never by swapping the old one out from under callers who
// depend on its exact shape. `channel` defaults to "rms", so every existing
// caller (goldens/multimodal, conformance/locate.test.js, and every caller
// that predates this) sees byte-identical output to before this change.
//
//   rms   (default) — loudness envelope. Sum of squares over a frame: sum is
//         commutative/associative, so permuting a frame's samples cannot
//         move it, and squaring discards sign, so polarity cannot either.
//         Carries energy and nothing else. scripts/RESULTS.md's invariance
//         audit measured exactly this gap ("permute samples within each
//         frame ... exactly identical") and it stays true for THIS channel —
//         RMS is still the loudness channel and loudness still does not
//         depend on arrangement.
//   flux  — mean absolute first-difference over a frame (a spectral-flux-
//         style statistic: how much the signal moves sample-to-sample, not
//         how loud it is). Permuting a frame's samples changes which values
//         are adjacent and hence every successive difference, so this
//         channel is order-sensitive by construction — it is the "minimally-
//         repaired reduction" the file's mutation-check paragraph predicted
//         would break the equality (it names zero-crossing rate; flux is the
//         same family: a statistic of adjacent samples, not of the frame's
//         multiset). It is ALSO polarity-invariant by construction
//         (|(-b)-(-a)| === |b-a|), so adding it does not cost the "holds:
//         polarity inversion" invariance RESULTS.md separately confirmed is
//         not a defect — a hearer really may ignore polarity, and this
//         channel keeps ignoring it too.
//
// See conformance/perceiver_invariance.test.js for the measured proof both
// ways: rms stays blind, flux does not, polarity survives on both.
