// native/adapters/text/relations-case-marked.js — grammatical role by
// MORPHOLOGY, not position. relations.js's own header says its slot-
// finding is positional: "the token immediately FOLLOWING a candidate
// referent surface... the slot SVO order puts a verb in." That is a fact
// about analytic, fixed-word-order languages (English, French, Chinese) —
// not a fact about clauses in general. Latin, Russian, Finnish, Japanese,
// Korean, and Sanskrit signal grammatical role through case morphology
// (a noun's own ending) or verb agreement, largely independent of
// position — several of these languages already sit in live_priors.
//
// THE ARRANGEMENT NEVER NEEDED GRAMMATICAL NAMES. Two ordered ends and a
// label is already typologically neutral (the-fold's grammar-lens
// section, and POLICIES.md P72 for the shape this organ targets natively:
// `{end1, label, end2}`, never `{subject, verb, object}` — Latin's case
// system does not map 1:1 onto English argument structure closely enough
// to justify borrowing those names a second time through a different
// mechanism). What varies per language is only WHERE to look for the two
// ends and the label — never which one is the agent.
//
// WHY LATIN, FIRST. Not because it is easy — because it is a bad fit for
// the positional mechanism, which is the actual generality test (S31's
// own gate: a fix scoped to a convenient case proves nothing). Latin has
// free constituent order (a real, held-out TEST specimen this organ
// matches exactly against gold: "possedit cetera pontus" — literally
// "possessed the-rest the-sea," verb-object-subject order — this organ
// correctly reports end1=pontus/end2=cetera with no notion of position
// at all) and a real, receivable case-ending system, so the mechanism can
// be built and measured rather than argued.
//
// THE PRIOR IS MEASURED, NOT TYPED IN. `live_priors/derived-priors/
// case-priors/case-marking-lat.json` (`LatinCasePrior@1` — moved there
// 2026-08-30, a received lexicon is content, not app logic, act-priors'
// own precedent) is built from UD_Latin-Perseus (Perseus Digital
// Library texts — Cicero, Ovid, the same classical register already in
// live_priors — CC BY-NC-SA 2.5, giver named, non-commercial noted
// plainly rather than glossed over) by `scripts/build-latin-case-prior.mjs`:
// for every nominal token (NOUN/PROPN/ADJ/PRON/NUM) with a Case feature in
// 1,334 training sentences, tally (word-final 2 characters -> Case|Number)
// and keep the WHOLE ranked distribution, never collapsed to one guess —
// the same ambiguity-preserved discipline pos-eng.json already holds.
// Some endings are genuinely decisive ("-am" is 100% Acc|Sing in this
// corpus); most are not ("-is" spans five distinct readings). A form
// whose ending the training sentences never attested, or whose top
// reading does not clear a declared confidence floor, is a typed gap —
// never a guess dressed as a case.
//
// VERB-FINDING IS RECEIVED, NOT MINED — a real, measured correction.
// The first cut mined 3-character verb-personal-endings from the SAME
// treebank the way case endings are mined above, and it under-covered
// badly: only 75 of 224 distinct endings observed in training cleared a
// volume-5 floor, because personal-ending morphology fragments by
// conjugation-stem vowel (-ent vs -unt vs -ant are all "3rd person
// plural," landing in different buckets) — a modest corpus sample does
// not contain enough of each to earn frequency-based trust. That is the
// structural-floor-vs-model-of-the-material distinction this codebase
// already draws elsewhere (meta-parameters-INVENTORY.md): personal-ending
// morphology is a closed grammatical fact (Allen & Greenough's New Latin
// Grammar, a public-domain standard reference — the giver), not something
// a frequency table should be asked to re-discover from a small sample.
// `esse` (to be — the single most frequent Latin verb, and among the most
// irregular: sum/es/est does not fit any stem+ending split) is a small,
// additional received closed class of its own present-indicative forms;
// imperfect/future/perfect forms of `esse` are a disclosed, unattempted
// extension.
//
// A SECOND REAL BUG, ALSO FOUND BY MEASURING AGAINST GOLD, NOT REASONED
// ABOUT: bare single-character personal endings ("-o" 1sg, "-m" 1sg,
// "-t" 3sg) collide constantly with common noun case endings ("-o" is
// also the 2nd-declension ablative singular; "-m" is also how EVERY
// 1st/2nd-declension accusative singular ends, "-am"/"-um"/"-em"). Left
// unguarded, this forced a spurious second "verb candidate" on 163 of 222
// real single-verb test sentences, reported as `ambiguous_verb`. A `weak`
// personal-ending match is now withdrawn when the SAME word ALSO reads as
// a confident nominal case — the more specific, better-calibrated signal
// wins — never withdrawn outright, which would have silently lost real
// 1sg/3sg coverage on words with no such collision.
//
// MEASURED, HONEST, NOT FORCED HIGHER. Full pipeline (raw sentence in,
// {end1,label,end2} out) against 380 held-out UD_Latin-Perseus TEST
// sentences (never used to build the prior) restricted to single-finite-
// verb clauses: end1 (vs gold nsubj) precision 0.24 / recall 0.07; end2
// (vs gold obj) precision 0.35 / recall 0.11. Modest by conventional NLP
// standards, and disclosed as exactly that rather than tuned past what
// the mechanism actually earned. Isolating the case-classification step
// alone (given the correct token directly, no verb-finding or sentence-
// level competition) shows why: of gold subjects, 82% get a confident
// case reading but only 36% of THOSE are correctly Nom — nominative is
// genuinely the least systematically marked Latin case (3rd-declension
// nominatives are often irregular, stem-final-consonant-driven rather
// than suffix-patterned) — a known fact in Latin morphology, not an
// artifact of this organ. Accusative fares much better (76% of confident
// readings correct) because -um/-am/-em are comparatively unambiguous.
// This asymmetry is reported, not smoothed over: `end1` and `end2` are
// NOT equally reliable, and a caller should not treat them as if they were.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT ATTEMPT. Multi-finite-verb sentences (clause
// segmentation — 559 of 939 test sentences were skipped from measurement
// for exactly this reason, named rather than silently included and
// scored wrong). Bare-stem imperatives (Latin's 2nd-singular imperative
// often has no personal ending at all — "mitte," "carpe" — indistinguishable
// from a noun stem by ending alone; a real, disclosed gap, not a bug).
// Dative/genitive/ablative-marked participants are typed as
// `object_slot_is_oblique_not_accusative`, never silently reported as
// `end2` — the exact SVO-shaped substitution ("call it the object because
// it isn't the subject") this organ exists to refuse. NOUN-PHRASE-INTERNAL
// AGREEMENT is not modeled — an attributive adjective or participle
// sharing its head noun's case ("deiectum leo," a fallen lion: both
// nominative, one word) reads as a SECOND same-case candidate and
// correctly, honestly gaps as `ambiguous_nominative`/`ambiguous_accusative`
// rather than guessing which of the two is the actual clausal argument.
// This is a real, disclosed ceiling on this organ's current recall, not a
// bug: resolving it needs phrase-boundary detection this pass does not
// attempt.

 *
 * @param {string} text one sentence, single finite verb. A sentence with

 * @param {object} options
 * @param {object} [options.casePrior] the LatinCasePrior@1 object.
 *   Defaults to `defaultLatinCasePrior()` (case-marking-lat.json);
 *   injectable for tests and for a future second case-marking language.
 * @param {string} [options.verbHint] an exact form to treat as the
 *   clause's verb, bypassing verb-finding — isolates role-assignment
 *   accuracy for measurement. Production callers never pass this.
 * @param {number} [options.minVolume] floor on an ending's training
 *   volume (default MIN_ENDING_VOLUME). @param {number} [options.minShare]
 *   floor on the top reading's share (default MIN_TOP_SHARE). The reader's
 *   own floors, declared per call — the Greek seam bred 0.6/20 on its own
 *   gold; Latin ships 5/0.4 until someone breeds better.
 * @param {Set} [options.excludeForms] closed forms never candidates
 *   (default LATIN_PREPOSITIONS). @param {Map} [options.exceptionCases]
 *   closed form -> { case, number } read before the ending vote (default
 *   null — Greek's enclitic datives are the standing instance).
