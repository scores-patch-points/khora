// eoreader6 · engine/operators — the 9 operators as the app's verb grid.
//
// Every verb of the app is one of these, aimed at some target, at some
// holonic height. The verb is the act; the target is a document or a passage
// inside it; the height is the grain the act lands on. "Everywhere" means the
// act is aimed at every target in the corpus — a prompt that does not name a
// single source is not a guess about which one, it is an address to all of
// them.
//
// THIS IS THE CUBE, AS ONE ALLOWED RUNTIME USE. CUBE.md says the cube is an
// instrument, not a runtime, and as a *classifier* (deriving a cell from
// content) it was measured and refuted — 95.7% of cell assignments survived
// shuffling words inside 2,527 paragraphs. This registry is not that act.
// Nothing here derives a cell from content. Each organ DECLARES the cell it
// already occupies, from its own header, and the surfer dispatches a prompt's
// verb to the organs of that cell. The instrument becomes a dispatch key, and
// the refusal to classify content stands. The tension with CUBE.md's sentence
// is recorded here rather than hidden: the instrument earned one runtime use,
// the one that turns a reader's verb into an addressed act.
//
// THE ALGEBRA IS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH, and it is the coherent one —
// terrain and stance are derived from (mode, domain, grain), never hand-listed.
// eoreader5 carried a hand-listed diagonal whose algebra refused five of its
// own nine cells; that contradiction is not re-inherited (CUBE.md). The cells
// declared here are the ones the engine's organs already claimed in their
// headers, checked against the derivation.
//
//   operator = (mode, domain)      NUL SIG INS / SEG CON SYN / DEF EVA REC
//   terrain  = (domain, grain)     Existence:      Void       Entity  Kind

// The verb vocabulary is host-facing and mechanical (English, no model):
//   NUL receive  · SIG scout  · INS admit  · SEG snip  · CON bind
//   SYN compile  · DEF refuse · EVA evaluate · REC rezero
// SEG IS SNIP: the SEG operation is the act of cutting a reach-unit out of
// the arena — boundaries found by form, the addressed unit brought to the
// reader byte-accurate, a window labelled a window never a chapter. The
// engine organs of the cell (segments, spans) do the finer acts under it.
