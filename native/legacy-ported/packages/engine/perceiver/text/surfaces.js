// eoreader6 · perceiver/text/surfaces — candidate referent surfaces, and the
// structural (engine-tier) coreference between them. No word sets anywhere:
// every filter here is derived from the text's own statistics.
//
// SCOPE (Constitution II.13, script earning test): diaNorm below folds only
// the five Latin vowels' acute/grave/circumflex/umlaut diacritics (á/à/â/ä
// ... ú/ù/û/ü). It is disclosed-narrow, not script-agnostic: it does NOT
// fold ñ/ç/ø/å/æ/ß/š/ž/ł or any non-Latin-vowel diacritic, and it does not
// touch combining marks in scripts where they carry phonemic/grammatical
// content rather than accent decoration (Vietnamese tone marks, Hebrew
// niqqud, Arabic tashkil, Devanagari matras) — a blanket Unicode
// combining-mark strip was tried and reverted for exactly this reason: it
// silently claimed cross-script generality with no invariance fixture to
// back it, which II.13 names as the more severe failure than a disclosed
// narrow scope ("the silence is the more severe failure than the scope").
// Extending coverage requires a giver (II.2) for each script's own folding
// rule and a fixture proving it, not an algorithmic generalization.
//
// TIER DISCIPLINE — the load-bearing part, and the reason this file is small:
//   ENGINE tier (derivable, built here): NAME-variant coreference.
//     "Victor Frankenstein" ≈ "Frankenstein" ≈ "Victor" by containment or
//     shared final token. Structural, no witness needed.
//   MODEL tier (NOT derivable, reported as a typed gap): descriptor synonymy
//     ("the creature" ≈ "the wretch") and PRONOUN binding ("he" -> whom).
//     eoreader5's dead-ends log records distributional coref failing twice
//     (frame-level lift, sentence-level complementary distribution). It is not
//     retried here. A missing prior produces a gap, never a guessed number.
//
// Ported rather than reinvented (CLAUDE.md names each of these a
// consistently-reinvented wheel): diaNorm, namesCorefer, the cap/lower
// physics filter, and whole-word counting all come from eoreader5's
// presence.js / entity-fold.js.

 *   is measured against — the fence keeps falling as more documents join,
 *   until it wrongly brands an ordinary name individuating-token as generic
 *   PURELY because other, unrelated documents were also in the batch.
 *   Measured live on the challenge-25 fixture: "kade" (correctly generic
 *   within source A alone, by A's own co-occurrence structure — it is A's
 *   title, not A's individuating evidence) additionally took "marcus" and
 *   "aurelius" down with it the moment source C's candidates joined the
 *   pool, because C's own one-off proper nouns (unrelated to Kade) pushed
 *   the POOLED fence to 1 — collapsing a within-document merge
 *   ("Marcus Aurelius" / "Marcus Aurelius Kade") that succeeds standalone.
 *   `groups`, when given, derives the generic set PER GROUP and unions the
 *   results — each document's own candidates are still judged against
 *   their OWN co-occurrence breadth, exactly as the single-document case
 *   already does; pooling more documents can only ADD generic tokens found
 *   within some document's own material, never dilute another document's
 *   fence with material foreign to it.
 *
 *   `deriveMinSentences`'s recurrence floor has the EXACT same compositional
 *   flaw and gets the same treatment: pooled flat, a richly-recurring
 *   document (many candidates recurring across many sentences) raises the
 *   25th-percentile floor past what a SHORT, sparser document's own
 *   candidates can ever clear — a name that individuates fine standalone
 *   drops out entirely the moment it is pooled with a longer document,
 *   never merging (there's no DEF.admit event to merge) rather than
 *   over-merging. `groups` derives the floor per group too, so each
