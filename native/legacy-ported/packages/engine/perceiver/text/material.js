/**
 * THE CONTAINER IS NOT THE WORK, and this path used to read it as one.
 *
 * `stripContainer` lived in `spans.js` and the sentence path called it; this —
 * the NUMERIC path, the one `surf`, `fold` and the whole `nul` substrate go
 * through — did not. So every ground built here was grown partly over the
 * distributor's licence.
 *
 * MEASURED, 2026-07-31, Heidi (Project Gutenberg 20781), 1376 chunks:
 *   - all 30 of `surf`'s wave-breaks fell in the licence, none in the novel;
 *   - from a standpoint at chunk 547, 38 of 60 placed positions (63%) were
 *     wrapper rather than Heidi, and the wrapper held the top of the ranking.
 *
 * eoreader5 had already found this and fixed it at ingest
 * (`packages/host/corpus.js::ingestFile`): "the markers bracket the actual
 * work, and leaving them in put license text into search results." That fix was
 * not re-earned here. This is it, re-earned at the perceiver rather than the
 * host, because this module is where the numeric material is born.
 *
 * NOT A MEASUREMENT, and it must not become one. Knowing where the container
 * ends is received knowledge about the FILE FORMAT — the same kind as knowing
 * an mp3 carries an ID3 header (see `spans.js`) — so markers are the right
 * instrument, not a weaker one. eoreader5's `emergence/boundaries/index.js`
 * records why the alternative fails: "concentration alone is a clustering
 * heuristic that happily individuates boilerplate." A salience measure finds
 * the wrapper BECAUSE the wrapper is statistically distinctive, which makes it
 * a false-positive generator rather than a detector.
 *
 * NO OFFSET IS CARRIED, deliberately. What this module produces is a
 * chunk-indexed series with no byte anchors, so there is nothing here for an
 * offset to correct. A caller mapping a position back to the FILE takes the
 * offset from `spans.js::stripContainer`, which returns `{ text, offset }` for
 * exactly that reason — eoreader5 measured the cost of dropping it on pg84.txt:
 * "spans came back verbatim but 686 bytes early, which looks correct in every
 * test that only re-reads through this process and is wrong the moment anyone
 * opens the file."
 *
 * A text with no markers passes through untouched.

// Causal surprisal: each chunk is scored against the frequency table of
// chunks BEFORE it only, never the whole document. A whole-document table

// measured against vocabulary it hasn't been read yet. This is eoreader5's
// forwardScore lesson (emergence/surprise/index.js), ported as a real
// mechanism, not an assertion: "how much new information would this add,
// given what's already been read" is a different, causally honest question
// from "how rare are these words across the whole book."
//
// `gamma` (default 1, undecayed — identical to this function before
// 2026-08-05) is belief.js's own forgetting rate, ported here for the same
// reason belief.js has one: "relevance is local and revisable, so it must be
// able to decay" (SEED.md Amendment IV.2). At gamma=1 an unseen word's cost,
// log2(table.total+1), is mathematically guaranteed to rise for as long as
// the document runs, REGARDLESS OF CONTENT — table.total only ever grows.
// That is a residual of the fix just above (the 0.297 measurement is real
// and stands, unchanged, as gamma=1's own number) and is large enough to
// make a healthy, non-degenerate atmosphere ground on a single coherent
// 250-chunk passage read as "surfeit" purely from position, confirmed
// directly: scripts/adversarial/challenge-7-rec-re-zero-atmosphere-boundary-
// correctn.mjs's cookery-alone negative control cleared its own ground at
// chunk ~199 with the series having drifted from ~5.4M to ~9M microbits,
// zero topic shift behind it.
//
// gamma<1 bounds table.total (and every word's own count) to a decaying
// window of recent reading — belief.js's lazy schedule, cell.v *
// gamma^(t−cell.t), applied per word and to the running total alike, so an
// unseen-in-a-while word costs what it would cost against a reader's
// EFFECTIVE recent memory, not against everything since page one. MEASURED,
// 2026-08-05 (scripts/causal-surprisal-gamma-calibration.mjs): at gamma=0.999
// (chunkSize=50 — half-life ≈ 14 chunks, ≈700 words) r(position, causal
// surprisal) on Frankenstein (pg84) falls from 0.443 (gamma=1) to -0.27, and
// the series stops climbing (chunk 30/400/800/last ≈ 7.0M/7.2M/6.9M/7.7M
// microbits, vs. gamma=1's 7.6M/9.3M/9.2M/10.7M). Ground-size alone cannot
// buy this back at gamma=1 — the same script confirms drift still clears a
// healthy ground at minimums up to 20*window — so this is not a
// ground-size substitute; both matter, see atmosphere.js's MIN_GROUND.
