// eoreader6 · perceiver/text/segments — structural boundaries, found not named.
//
// A reader has to know where one stretch of a source ends and the next begins
// before it can be asked for "the next chapter" or "the scene where". This
// organ finds those boundaries by FORM and nothing else: the words a source
// uses for its headings ("Chapter", "Letter", "Scene", "Movement") are that
// source's own surfaces, not this module's vocabulary. Nothing here knows any
// of them, and it fires identically on a numbered movement in a score with no
// words at all — the omnimodal commitment, same as material.js and spans.js.
//
// RE-EARNED, NOT PORTED. eoreader-chat carried this machinery for eoreader5's
// corpus; it is brought here under eoreader6's terms, with the measured
// lessons carried as design rather than copied as code:
//
//  1. A heading is form, not content. A short line, followed by a blank line,
//     that is numbered, roman-numeraled, all-caps, or Title Case word pair.
//     "Chapter 1" scores the same way "Movement 3" and "Sinfonia 9" do,
//     because the pattern is WORD + NUMBER, and the word is not named.
//
//  2. A sentence is not a heading. A line ending in . ! ? — after trailing
//     quotes are stripped, so "Mary Bolkónskaya.”" cannot wave through on its
//     closing quote — is prose, not a boundary. The one exception is a bare
//     roman numeral ("XVIII."), which is a heading's own punctuation.
//
//  3. A name is not a heading. A leading abbreviation-shaped token followed
//     by a capitalised word ("Mr. Darcy", "St. Petersburg") is an honourific
//     + name line — the same false positive the surfaces organ fights with
//     its ratio filter. Refused by form (abbrev. + Capital), never by list.
//
//  4. A listing is not a structure. A book's own table of contents is a wall
//     of perfectly heading-shaped lines with nothing under them. A candidate
//     earns its place by what opens beneath it, or it is dropped — and the
//     front matter falls into the preamble, which the reader still renders.
//
//  5. Fewer than two boundaries is a typed gap, never a one-entry table of
//     contents. A document we found no structure in should say so.
//
//  6. A window edge is a window, not a chapter. When no heading stands behind
//     an anchor inside the reach, the segment starts at the window edge and
//     is LABELLED as such — a segment title fabricated from a mid-sentence
//     line is a false permanency, and saying "(context window — no heading
//     precedes this passage)" instead of inventing one is the whole refusal.
//
//  7. No level. Whether one heading nests under another is a holon-level
//     claim, and level is discovered from existence-dependency, never
//     inferred from a heading's typographic form. The outline is flat, and
//     honest about being flat.
//
// UNIT CONTRACT — the drift that this file exists to prevent. Offsets are
// unit-ambiguous until a caller says what they are: `lineIndex` builds
// UTF-16 code-unit starts, a byte-addressable host builds byte starts. The
// engine treats them as opaque and always returns the same unit it was given.
// What is FORBIDDEN is mixing them — slicing a string by byte offsets, or
// counting line starts in code units against a byte anchor, silently drifts
// on the first non-ASCII character. eoreader-chat measured that failure on
// Sanskrit and Chinese corpus labels and it is not re-created here.
//
// Pure: no clock, no I/O, no randomness, no model. A prompt is never required
// to name a word; the number forms (arabic, roman) ARE convertible here
// because they are form, and form is this organ's whole remit.

// The cell this organ occupies on the operator grid (engine/operators.js):

// accent map the surfaces organ uses (diaNorm — never a third map; a collision
// it causes is ambiguity, a typed gap, never a silently wrong segment), and
// numbers compared across numeral forms. The boundary's own words must appear
// in the prompt as a contiguous run — "snip chapter 2 of the book" contains
// "chapter 2", and the leading and trailing words of the prompt are the
// reader's, not ours. A prompt that says "the second chapter" does not address
// this heading by form — "second" is an English ordinal, a prior word, and the
// caller falls through to content search rather than pretending to understand
// it.
//
// NUMERALS ARE FORM, IN EVERY DIGIT SCRIPT. ASCII digits carry an intrinsic
// value ("chapter 18" finds "CHAPTER XVIII", "chapter 2" finds "CHAPTER II"),
// and non-ASCII digit scripts (Devanagari १, Arabic-Indic ١) are compared by
// their own surface: a Hindi heading "अध्याय २" is addressed by a prompt that
// writes "अध्याय २", never by "अध्याय 2". Crossing a digit-script boundary
// ("2" ⟶ "२") is a value claim, and value claims are prior knowledge —
// language word-forms and digit-script mappings alike belong in eoPriors, and
// the engine reports a miss rather than pretending a २ is a 2.
