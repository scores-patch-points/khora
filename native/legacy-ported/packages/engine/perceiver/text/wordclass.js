// eoreader6 · perceiver/text/wordclass — Dionysius Thrax's eight parts of
// speech as a giver-named LENS over a word, never a fact this engine
// derives. Composes two already-received priors; invents no new mechanism.
//
// THE FINDING THIS CLOSES. hypergraph.js's relation edges read a triple as
// (subject, verb, object), and "verb" was never checked against anything —
// it is whatever token sits in the connector slot. Read against real
// material (the-fold's eval/results/asserted-crosslingual.md), the
// connector slot holds "this" ("that" —this→ "means war"), "still" ("if
// you" —still→ "try"), "book" ("CHAPTER XII" —book→ "ONE"): a pronoun, an
// adverb, a noun, each called a verb because nothing ever asked. That is
// not a bug in a classifier; it is a category never applied. This module
// applies it, honestly: SLOT (which position a span fills in a clause —
// extractRelations's own first-span/connector/second-span structure) and
// CLASS (what part of speech a word's FORM is, independent of any one
// clause) are two different axes, kept separate by Halliday's Systemic
// Functional Grammar for exactly this reason (function vs. class — a
// function can be realised by any class). This file answers CLASS only.
// Nothing here reads or knows about a clause, a triple, or a slot.
//
// TWO PRIORS, TWO GIVERS, NEVER MERGED INTO ONE CLAIM.
//   1. MEASURED: which classes a form is attested as, and how often, in a
//      real human-annotated treebank — Universal Dependencies
//      UD_English-EWT (CC BY-SA 4.0), via THIS repo's own
//      scripts/build-pos-prior.mjs (POSPrior@1), which existed, was never
//      run, and is run for the first time by this pass. Ambiguity is
//      PRESERVED in the prior (its own header says so) and preserved again
//      here — classifyWord never picks a winner.
//   2. DECLARED: which of Dionysius Thrax's eight ancient categories
//      (Tekhnē grammatikē, Alexandria, ~100 BCE) a UD tag corresponds to.
//      This is a TRANSLATION between two schemes built 2,100 years apart,
//      not a fact — THRAX_MAP's own comments name exactly where the two do
//      and do not line up, including the additions Thrax's own text never
//      made (interjection: Donatus and Priscian, Latin, a few centuries
//      later, replacing the article Latin has none of).
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO. It does not collapse an ambiguous word to one
// class — that is exactly the move `perceiver/text/roles.js::resolveSpanRole`
// already exists for, at the right grain: a TYPE-level frequency table
// ("book is usually a noun") cannot answer an INSTANCE-level question
// ("book" in THIS clause), and the-fold's own CLAUDE.md already carries the
// postmortem for treating those as the same question (mine-1-unimorph-
// disambiguated: a determiner-adjacency vote over type frequency introduced
// real contradictions a caller never asked for). `dominantClass` below is
// the one permitted convenience, and it takes its cut DECLARED, never
// defaulted, the same discipline resolveSpanRole's own minActivation/
// minMargin already hold.
