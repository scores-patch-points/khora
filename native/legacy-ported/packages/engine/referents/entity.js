// eoreader6 · referents/entity — THE EXISTENCE · FIGURE COLUMN.
//
// The registry (engine/operators.js) had four empty cells where a being should
// be, and the emptiness was load-bearing rather than incidental:
//
//   NUL · Figure   Entity · Dissecting    the nothing a being is seen against
//   SIG · Figure   Entity · Binding       is this being here, now
//   INS · Figure   Entity · Making        a being comes into existence
//   REC · Figure   Entity · Making        the register the next turn receives
//
// Everything Figure-grained that existed was CON · Figure — `referents/index`,
// `emergence/activation`, `perceiver/text/relations` — the LINKS BETWEEN
// entities that nothing had created. `referents/index::projectReferents` folds
// DEF.admit events, and the only generator of those events was
// `perceiver/text/admit::admitFromPrior`: a received prior. So a being could
// enter this engine only if a human had already named it. `referents/blind`'s
// own header states the objection: "If real existence-detection can only run
// when a human has already curated a prior, it isn't sensing, it's being
// handed the answer."
//
// THE ONE RULE THAT SHAPES EVERY FUNCTION HERE: this reads left to right.
// State carries only what has arrived. No frequency table over the whole
// document, no occupancy over an arena that includes unread pages, no
// second pass. `loops/turn.js` says of ③ INS that it "makes the read a READING
// rather than an analysis of a finished object" — that is the operator this
// column hangs from, and a batch implementation of it is not a slower reader,
// it is a different thing wearing the name.
//
// A BEING IS NOT A STRING. Surfaces are scoped evidence; identity lives in the
// referent (the nameless-referent principle). Nothing here compares spellings.
// Binding surfaces that point at one being is CON · Pattern and lives in
// ./consequence.js — identity by consequence, never by appearance.
