// eoreader6 · emergence/surprise — the two lanes, kept apart, and the one
// boundary where they provably coincide.
//
//   NOVELTY / SHANNON SURPRISAL   -log2 P(outcome)
//     How improbable was this, under what I believed? A property of the event
//     given a model. Additive over independent observations — which is why it
//     is log-scaled, and why accumulating it over a read path is legitimate.
//
//   BAYESIAN SURPRISE             D_KL(posterior || prior)
//     How far did belief MOVE? Itti & Baldi. A rare event that shifts nothing
//     (a ship's manifest) scores low; a common-worded sentence that forces
//     revision ("I beheld the wretch") scores high. NON-ADDITIVE and not
//     decomposable across observations: this is a per-observation snapshot,
//     never a running total, and averaging it over a window is a category
//     error. (Committed exactly that error once; see git history.)
//
// THE BOUNDARY INVARIANT, enforced in conformance/surprise.test.js:
//   When the posterior is a genuine point mass — full commitment, no residual
//   amplitude on the road not taken — KL(delta_a || prior) collapses
//   algebraically to -log2 P(a). The two lanes are non-collapsible IN
//   GENERAL and provably identical AT FULL COMMITMENT. Any drift between them
//   at that boundary is a normalisation bug, not a modelling choice. It is a
//   real bug-catcher: an earlier prior here spread its novelty reserve over
//   all forms instead of only unseen ones, so p_prior did not sum to 1, and
//   the tell was a clamp (`Math.max(0, kl)`) on a quantity that is
//   non-negative by construction.
//
// ON THE BORN-RULE VOCABULARY, stated precisely because the physics is real
// and the borrowing is not the physics, IN THIS MODULE. What does formal work
// here is the COLLAPSE-AS-MEASUREMENT STRUCTURE: surprise is not a fluid
// dribbling out across a read, it is concentrated at discrete measurement
// events, and the windows of surprise are the intervals between them. What
// does NOT do formal work in THIS module's own "Born null" is |amplitude|^2
// weighting — it is a conditional null distribution, generated and scored
// classically: an analogy on the weighting law and a structural claim on the
// collapse, both of which hold here without the quantum formalism.
//
// CORRECTED (2026-09-26): this used to claim |amplitude|^2 weighting "does
// NOT do formal work anywhere in this repo" — true when this file was ported
// from eoreader6.1 (2026-09-10), false the very next day. adapters/text/
// anchoring.js's born mode (`bornOf`) computes p_i = a_i^2 / Sum(a^2) to bind
// a descriptor to a referent, and eval/lavar/elenchus-bar.mjs's
// `bornAcceptance` gates an evolutionary candidate on its delta^2 against the
// population's own delta^2 quantile — both real |amplitude|^2 weighting,
// both tested and load-bearing (tests/anchoring.test.js asserts a real
// binding's bornMass > 0.9). The vocabulary is borrowed HERE; elsewhere in
// this repo the physics is actually run.

/**
 * The Born-shaped null: what KL would this frame produce if belief were NOT
 * really moving — if the text simply continued as the prior expects?
 *
 * Conditional per observation, generated from the reader's own belief, never
 * a global constant. A shuffle null cannot answer this: shuffling a series
 * leaves the multiset of its values untouched, so for a per-observation
 * statistic it is vacuous — which is exactly why `burstiness` exists for the
 * order-sensitive case (SEED.md: "a statistic must be sensitive to what its
 * perturbation destroys").
 *
 * Returns the null KLs, sorted. The caller ranks the real observation against
 * them; a run of exceedances IS a window of surprise, discovered rather than
 * declared.
 *
 * `novelRate` — THE STRAWMAN THIS NULL HAS WHEN THE MATERIAL IS SPARSE.
 *
 * A continuation drawn from the prior can only ever contain forms the prior
 * ALREADY HOLDS. Over word-forms that is nearly harmless: by the time a reader
 * has a prior worth the name, most words in the next sentence are words it has
 * seen. Over sparse forms it is fatal. MEASURED on War and Peace with the tier
 * stack reading graph EDGES (emergence/tiers.js): 264 nodes and 98 live
 * relations across 532 observations, so most frames carry an edge the prior has
 * never held — the real arrival then beats every null draw *by construction*,
 * and the gate fired on 233 of 532 observations, in unbroken runs. That is not
 * a gate, and a null that the observation clears by construction is SEED.md #3
 * at the level of the perturbation: "it would clear anything put in front of
 * it."
 *
 * So the null may be told how novel a continuation should EXPECT to be. Each
 * token is, with probability `novelRate`, a form the prior has never held
 * (distinct per token, the way genuinely new forms arrive) rather than a draw
 * from the prior's mass. The question becomes the honest one — "did this move
 * belief further than a continuation AS NOVEL AS USUAL would have" — instead of
 * "did anything new happen at all."
 *
 * `novelRate` is MEASURED by the caller from its own history, never declared;
 * the default of 0 is exactly the previous behaviour, so existing callers
 * (scripts/read-frankenstein.mjs, conformance/surprise.test.js) are unchanged.
