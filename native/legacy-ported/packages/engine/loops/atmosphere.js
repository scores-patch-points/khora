// An atmosphere boundary is therefore not a topic label or a punctuation
// rule — it is the position at which a reader's accumulated ground stops

// reader-relative, and medium-agnostic: this would segment a symphony into
// movements by the same operation it uses to segment prose into scenes.
//
// `tolerance` is declared, never defaulted, for the same reason draws and
// window are: it is the resolution of REFUSAL — how many consecutive
// clearings before the ground is conceded to be the wrong one. A tolerance
// of 1 re-zeros on every outlier and finds boundaries everywhere; a
// tolerance the length of the material finds none.

/**
 * Is this series stationary enough for a windowed ground to BE a ground?
 *
 * WHAT THIS EXISTS TO CATCH, measured, not hypothetical. `emergence/
 * activation.js`'s `recalled` channel climbs monotonically across a reading —
 * 0 through the first ~15 frames of Frankenstein, ~127 by frame 140 — because
 * posting lists grow as the read proceeds: more prior frames exist to answer,
 * so more answer. Feed that to `createRegimeTracker` and every ground built
 * over a trailing window is exceeded by what follows STRUCTURALLY, whatever
 * the content says. Clearings accumulate, `tolerance` trips, the ground
 * rebuilds one level higher, and the cycle repeats at a period fixed by
 * `groundFrom`'s own `10*window` minimum. Measured on the committed
 * Frankenstein fixture: re-zeros at frames 133, 255, 377, 499, 621, 743 —
 * spaced exactly 122 apart — and 30 shuffled-order controls returned a mean
 * of 6.00 re-zeros with standard deviation 0.00, identical to the real
 * reading. A metronome, not an Atmosphere. The trend was never cleared out of
 * the ground; it BECAME the ground.
 *
 * THE TEST. Compare the mean of the last quarter against the mean of the
 * first quarter, ranked against a null built by shuffling the series' own
 * values — nul's licensed perturbation for order questions, the same device
 * `slackRunNull` above already uses on its own run of flags.
 *
 * This is a DIRECT test of the property that matters, not a proxy for it. The
 * question a ground-builder needs answered is "is the ground built at the
 * start still a valid ground at the end," and comparing the ends asks exactly
 * that. A trend ends far from where it started; a burst rises and returns.
 *
 * FOUR ALTERNATIVES WERE TESTED AND REFUSED. Kept on the record with their
 * measured numbers so the next person does not re-walk them:
 *
 *   HALF-SPLIT mean comparison — tests the wrong property. Any burst sitting
 *     past the midpoint lifts the second half's mean, and most bursts do.
 *   SPEARMAN rank correlation with position — degenerate on this material.
 *     `recalled` is mostly ties at zero (68 of 83 values in the fixture that
 *     exposed it), which drags rho to 0.95 for a burst that plainly returns.
 *   REVERSAL asymmetry (does the reading depend on which way time runs) —
 *     measured fwd/rev re-zero counts: Frankenstein 6/0, mid-burst 1/1,
 *     end-burst 1/0. Separates the trend, but flags the end-burst too,
 *     because an end-burst reversed becomes a START-burst that fires before
 *     `groundFrom`'s 10*window minimum has been met.
 *   VALUE-SHUFFLE invariance (is the output blind to order) — measured real
 *     vs shuffled-null: Frankenstein 6 vs 0.00, mid-burst 1 vs 0.13,
 *     end-burst 1 vs 0.00. Every signal case exceeds its null, so this
 *     separates signal from noise but not trend from burst.
 *
 * THE END-QUARTER CASE IS NOT A FALSE POSITIVE. It is an identity, and this
 * is provable rather than arguable: a burst occupying the final quarter and
 * the PREFIX OF A TREND are the same series. Construct both — sixty flat
 * values followed by a rise — and they are byte-identical. No statistic can
 * separate them because there is no difference to separate; the evidence that
 * would distinguish "this returns" from "this is the new level" is the
 * material after the end, which a causal reader does not have and will not
 * invent. Refusing is therefore correct, not conservative-but-wrong: the
 * honest answer to "is this a trend" at that moment is that the reading
 * cannot yet tell, and a gap is what this engine says when it cannot tell.
 * Once the return arrives the same series is admitted (conformance holds
 * both halves of this).
 *
 * A GAP, NEVER A CORRECTION. This returns a typed gap or null. It does not
 * detrend, difference, or rescale the series — repairing a caller's material
 * silently is how a measurement stops being the caller's. What to do about a
 * trending channel is the caller's declaration to make.
 *
 * `reseeds` and `seed` are declared by the caller for the same reason every
 * other null's resolution is.

/**
 * The same three operators, driven one arrival at a time.
 *
 * `readAtmosphere` above segments material that has already fully arrived: at
 * position i it compares a ground built on [regionStart, i) against a window
 * [i, i+window) that lies AHEAD of the ground. That is fine for segmentation
 * and fatal for prediction — a predictor that peeks at [i, i+window) to decide
 * where its regime starts has already seen the value it is about to be scored
 * on. So this is not a wrapper around the function above and must not become
 * one: the ground precedes the observation in both, but here BOTH lie strictly
 * in the past, ground on [regionStart, t−window) and observation on
 * [t−window, t). The decision rule is identical; only the horizon moves.
 *
 * Feed it revealed values with `push`, in order. `regimeStart` is then the
 * index at which the current ground was last conceded — the only thing a
 * caller needs to know to answer "how much of my history is contemporary with
 * itself right now."
 *
 * `tolerance` is declared for the same reason it is declared above: it is the
 * resolution of refusal, and a default would decide in advance how eager this
 * is to concede.
 *
 * `push` also returns `placement`: this ground's relation to THIS arrival, as
 * one of three, because the three Interpretation×Ground operators already are
 * that distinction and collapsing them loses the middle one.
 *
 *   PLACED    EVA · Tending      the ground places the arrival. No news.
 *   STRAINED  DEF · Clearing     the arrival exceeds this ground, but the
 *                                ground still stands — a correction, not a
 *                                different world. `tolerance` exists to hold
 *                                exactly this state open.
 *   OTHER     REC · Cultivating  enough strain has accumulated to concede;
 *                                the ground is given up and regrown here.
 *
 * This is eoreader4.2's monitor triad (enactor/monitor.js: SELF /
 * SELF_MISMATCH / WORLD) without the authorship it assumed. There, SELF meant
 * "I emitted this and sensed it return." This engine emits nothing, so the
 * claim available here is weaker and is named for what it actually is: the
 * GROUND places the arrival, not "the arrival is mine." Self/world is the
 * special case this collapses into once there is an author to close the loop
 * — see SEED.md's relativity debt, which is why that author does not exist
 * yet. A boolean here would fuse STRAINED and OTHER, which is the difference
 * between a ground being corrected and a ground being abandoned.
 *
 * When there is no ground to judge against at all — too little material has
 * arrived to span a window, or one could not be built over the region —
 * `placement` is a TYPED GAP, never PLACED. Reporting "no ground yet" as "the
