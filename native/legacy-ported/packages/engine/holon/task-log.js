// eoreader6 · engine/holon/task-log — the append-only log, re-earned as
// engine code.
//
// Re-earned, not ported (constitution Article I.2: "nothing is ported from
// [legacy]; every organ is re-earned... a legacy organ that has not been
// re-earned does not exist for placement purposes"). This module first
// existed as eochat/server/task-log.js, an application file. It passed the
// omnimodal test (II.1 — "would a leitmotif in a symphony have this
// problem?") empirically: the identical code, unmodified, drove music
// composition, essay generation, fiction, numeric prediction, multi-file
// code, and SVG diagrams. No clock, no I/O, no randomness, no prior (III.2) —
// `seq` is a logical counter the log supplies itself, never a received `ts`.
// That is what earns the move; nothing about the mechanism changed to
// deserve it.
//
// What re-earning corrected, not just relocated:
//
//   Operator identity and production order used to be a hand-rolled partial
//   copy (application-side eo-cube.js / an invented HELIX ordering). Both are
//   now read from THIS package's own operators.js — GRAINS, cellOf,
//   OPERATOR_ORDER, validateChain — the single source the rest of the engine
//   already answers to: NUL (ground) -> SEG (split) -> SIG (signal) -> CON
//   (bind) -> EVA (gate) -> DEF (define) -> INS (instantiate) -> SYN
//   (synthesize) -> REC (recognize), the actual earned dependency order, not
//   the (mode, domain) grid's own declaration order. `isProductionOrder`
//   below is a thin wrapper over `validateChain`, not a second ordinal table
//   that could silently drift from the real one.
//
//   `deriveLevels`' existence-dependency is DECLARED, not MEASURED, and says
//   so in its own doc comment below. `holon_level/index.js` already has a
//   real, Born-null-gated version of the same two tests (existence-
//   dependency, possibility-constraint) for CONTINUOUS material (a numeric
//   series and a regime). This module's material is a DISCRETE graph
//   (`depends_on` edges between task_ids), and `ground()`/`STATISTICS` in
//   nul/index.js has no statistic shaped for that yet — building one
//   properly means a new perturbation+statistic pair, licensed and
//   calibration-tested the way `holon_level`'s own header records its first
//   null being wrong (17/60 false positives at nominal 5%) before it was
//   fixed. That is real, separate work. Until it exists, `deriveLevels` here
//   is an honestly-named sibling (the same "siblings, not one
//   generalization" pattern as generation/tasks.js vs prediction/tasks.js) —
//   a stated CLAIM about dependency, never dressed as a measurement it has
//   not earned.
//
// The core discipline carried over unchanged, because it is what keeps this
// module from rotting:
//
//   No clock. Ordering is `seq`, a logical counter supplied by the log
//   itself. Callers may attach their own timestamps as opaque payload;
//   nothing here reads them.
//
//   No silent coercion. An entry that cannot be typed produces an explicit
//   null-with-reason, never a guess. A missing operator is `null` with a
//   stated basis, not a default.

 * scope `isProductionOrder`/`isGrainProgression` already have. Existence-
 * dependency (`depends_on`) is a SEPARATE, additional constraint about the
 * fold's actual content that this function does not and should not know
 * about; a cell can be geometrically reachable and still be blocked by a
 * prerequisite that has not completed. The two are checked separately on
 * purpose — conflating them would mean a content fact (is X done) silently
 * gating a structural fact (is X→Y a legal move in the algebra), which is
 * exactly the kind of collapse `no-classifier-in-gates` refuses one level
 * up, for a different reason: geometry and content answer different
 * questions and neither should stand in for the other.
 *
 * `admits` narrows the operator axis to what a specific log accepts (see
 * `createTaskLog`), defaulting to all nine — the same declared-choice
 * discipline `admits` already has everywhere else in this module.
