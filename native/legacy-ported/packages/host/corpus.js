// ── serializeSession / deserializeSession — the export/reimport boundary ────
//
// eoreader6 itself makes no persistence claim (SEED.md/CUBE.md name none) —
// but a HOST built on this library (eochat, storing sessions in an
// origin-private OPFS) cannot honor "reimported state is fold-equivalent to
// the original" if the library it wraps offers no way to carry a session's
// terrain (spans, documents) and ledger (provenance) across the origin
// boundary at all. Measured
// (scripts/adversarial/challenge-20-export-reimport-fidelity.mjs, step 5):
// the single most obvious thing an engineer reaches for first — handing
// createSession()'s return value straight to JSON.stringify — round-trips
// every native Map as `{}` and silently destroys 100% of a real 31-span,
// 2-document terrain. Not a hypothetical: run against a real fold from the
// real pipeline, `reimported.spans instanceof Map` comes back `false` and
// the very next searchSpans() throws.
//
// The fix is narrow because the session was ALREADY plain-data-shaped —
// that same diagnostic is what shows it: every span, document, and
// provenance entry is a frozen/plain object with no closures anywhere in
// it; only the CONTAINERS are Maps, which is exactly the one shape JSON has
// no notation for. So serialize does one job — Map -> Array of [key, value]
// entries, which is what a Map's own iterator already yields (`[...map]`,
// not a rebuild) — and deserialize does the inverse, `new Map(entries)`.
//
// `_bytes` (snipRange/snipSegment's per-document byte-buffer + line-index
// cache) and `_cast` (discoveredCast's per-document memoisation) are
// deliberately NOT carried across the boundary: both are pure derived
// caches, recomputed lazily and deterministically from `documents` on next
// use (snipRange's own `cached ?? byteIndex(...)`; discoveredCast's
// chunk-count invalidation) — carrying them would mean carrying
// re-derivable bytes for nothing, and `_bytes`'s `idx.lengthOf` is a
// closure, which is not JSON-safe at all. Losing them costs a reimported
// session nothing it cannot recompute the moment it is asked; losing
// `spans`, `documents`, or `provenance` would cost the corpus itself
// (searchSpans/foldSpans/readSpan/snip* all read spans or documents) and
// the ledger (register/lookup read provenance) — which is why only those
// three needed fixing, per this project's convention of adding a named
// channel alongside what exists rather than redesigning the session shape.

// sessionReferents — the cast of one document.
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACES. Until now this function echoed the prior back and
// invented its numbers: `mentions: doc.chunks.length`, `frames:
// min(chunks,10)`, `lastFrame: chunks-1` — the same three values for every
// referent, none of them counted from the text. A document with no prior
// returned an empty cast, which is why the app's entity rail and Orbit were
// blank for every source but Frankenstein. Fabricated counts are worse than
// the empty cast, because a reader cannot tell them apart from measurements.
//
// Both are now read off the material by the engine's own organs, which
// already existed and were simply never called from the host:
//
//   spans.js::splitSentences        real sentence units with offsets
//   spans.js::deriveAbbreviations   tokens this text always writes with a dot
//   material.js::functionWordSet    closed class from THIS text's Zipf curve
//   surfaces.js::extractSurfaces    candidate surfaces + the cap/lower filter
//   surfaces.js::discoverReferents  name-variant coreference -> DEF.admit
//   referents/index.js::projectReferents   the canonical event projection
//   pronouns.js::resolvePronouns    third-person singular pronouns bound to
//                                   the discovered cast by one-hop activation
//                                   recall — see the header note below.
//
// TIER DISCIPLINE is inherited unchanged from surfaces.js and is the reason
// this is honest rather than a regex NER: name-variant coreference is
// ENGINE tier (derivable); descriptor synonymy is MODEL tier and still comes
// back as a typed gap, never a guessed number. A prior, when one exists,
// outranks discovery for the surfaces it claims.
//
// PRONOUN BINDING IS PARTIAL, AND SAID SO. surfaces.js's own gap
// ("pronoun_and_descriptor_mentions_unresolved") is not retired here — it is
// narrowed. Third-person singular pronouns ("he"/"she" and their forms) in a
// sentence with no named surface are offered to resolvePronouns, which binds
// one only when its one-hop recall against the already-discovered cast
// clears two declared bars (activation floor, margin over the runner-up);
// short of either, the pronoun stays exactly the same unresolved gap it
// always was. Resolved pronoun mentions are counted SEPARATELY from literal
// name mentions (`pronounMentions`/`pronounFrames`, never folded into
// `mentions`/`frames`) — merging them would let an activation-bound guess
// masquerade as a name occurrence, and countAcrossChunks's substring
// counting has no way to tell one pronoun's referent from another's.
//
// KNOWN LIMIT, declared not hidden: extractSurfaces gates on capitalisation,
// which is a property of Latin/Greek/Cyrillic script. On Han text it returns
// nothing (goldens/cast/README.md measured this). That is reported as a gap
// on a document where sentences exist but no surface survived, so the caller
// sees "this detector does not apply here" rather than "this text has no
// cast".

// INDIVIDUATION_TYPES, populated for the first time ────────────────────────
//
// `INDIVIDUATION_TYPES` (engine/referents/index.js) has named "apparatus"
// as one of five individuation kinds since that file's first line, and
// nothing anywhere in this repo ever assigned it — every discovered
// referent's `individuation` stayed the literal `null` this file's own
// comment already flags ("the caller sees null and applies its own
// policy"). This is that policy, for exactly this one kind, built on ONE
// measured, derived signal — not the general mass x coupling x agency
// classifier the other four kinds (field/emanon/protogon/holon) would still
// need; that is a genuinely larger, un-built subsystem and stays out of
// scope here.
//
// THE SIGNAL: what share of the document's OWN sentences a referent is
// named in. A narrating apparatus — a wire-service byline, a news outlet
// repeated as the attribution frame — gets re-stapled onto nearly every
// sentence precisely BECAUSE English third-person-singular pronouns do not
// apply to an organisation the way they do to a person: there is no "she"
// standing in for it, so the proper noun itself has to recur. A real
// narrative subject, however central, does not: prose carries a person
// forward with pronouns and unnamed continuation, so even the single most
// heavily NAMED character in an entire novel is named in only a small
// fraction of its sentences.
//
// MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED, against real fixtures already in this repo
// (scripts/adversarial/fixtures/), using the exact per-sentence occurrence
// count this file already applies per-chunk two functions up:
//   Frankenstein (pg84-frankenstein.txt, 3392 sentences): Elizabeth Lavenza,
//     the MOST-named character in the whole novel, 90/3392 sentences = 2.7%.
//   Heart of Darkness (2476 sentences): Mr Kurtz — discussed constantly
//     while physically absent for nearly the whole book, the protogon case
//     challenge #24 names — still only 113/2476 sentences = 4.6%.
//   The adversarial wire-service fixture (scripts/adversarial/fixtures/
//     wire-quiet-subject.txt, 40 sentences): "Continental Newswire",
//     21/40 sentences = 52.5% — an order of magnitude past either real
//     figure above, with real prose's own most extreme case (Kurtz, 4.6%)
//     nowhere near it.
// The floor below sits at 15%: comfortably above every real narrative
// referent measured (2.7%–4.6%), comfortably below the adversarial case
// (52.5%), and re-run against the exact numbers above rather than picked
// to fit one fixture (see scripts/adversarial/challenge-23-apparatus-

//
// (engine/referents/index.js's own INDIVIDUATION_TYPES has named
// field/emanon/protogon/holon/apparatus since that file's first line.
// "apparatus" is populated above, by one derived signal. This is the "genuinely
// larger, un-built subsystem" that section's own comment named as out of
// scope for that fix — built here, on the same discipline: a real signal,
// measured against real fixtures already in this repo, never assumed.)
//
// "field" stays definitionally unreachable, unchanged: a referent record
// only exists once something has recurred enough to be discovered or
// witnessed at all, and field names exactly the diffuse case that never
// individuates that far — there is nothing for this function to be asked
// to classify a field AS.
//
// THREE SIGNALS, ONE STRUCTURAL AND TWO STATISTICAL:
//
//   mass     — this referent's own `mentions` (already computed above).
//              Used here only as a RELIABILITY FLOOR: below it, no ratio
//              built on `mentions` has enough evidence to trust, so the
//              classifier declines rather than guesses (MASS_FLOOR, below).
//   coupling — pronounMentions / mentions, already computed and sitting on
//              every discovered referent unused before this. How much the
//              discourse's own grammar orbits this referent beyond bare
//              naming.
//   agency   — NEW. Real (subject, verb, object) triples already exist in
//              this codebase (perceiver/text/relations.js, discoveredCast's
//              own `relations`, above) — this is the first place they are
//              read PER REFERENT rather than as a flat list. agency is the
//              share of a referent's own mentions that occurred specifically
//              in subject position of an extracted relation: how often this
//              being enacts something, relative to how often it is merely
//              named.
//
// MEASURED, not assumed, against the two real literary fixtures challenge
// #24 itself used (scripts/adversarial/fixtures/pg84-frankenstein.txt,
// heart-of-darkness.txt) plus the human-curated coref prior for "the
// creature" (pg84-frankenstein.coref.json):
//
//   MASS_FLOOR = 15. Every noise-tier referent measured in Heart of
//   Darkness (Company 14, "I've" 14, English 13, Europe 8, Russian 8, God
//   7 — places, nationalities, and split contractions, not people) sits at
//   or below 14 mentions; every real named character measured in either
//   fixture (Frankenstein's own cast, 26-92 mentions; Kurtz, 121) sits well
//   above it. The one real exception is Marlow — Heart of Darkness's own
//   first-person narrator, whose third-person NAME is used only 10 times
//   because he is telling the story as "I," a structural property of
//   first-person narration this signal cannot see past. He is left
//   unclassified (null) rather than guessed at from too little naming
//   evidence — the honest outcome, not a special case.
//
//   PROTOGON_COUPLING_FLOOR = 1.0 — "referred to by pronoun MORE than
//   named outright." Measured against every mass-qualified referent in
//   both fixtures (Frankenstein's own eight: 0.07-0.83; Heart of Darkness's
//   own: 2.06 for Kurtz alone, everything else below the mass floor):
//   coupling never exceeds 1.0 for anyone except Kurtz, discussed and
//   pronoun-referenced for most of the book despite being physically
//   absent until Part III — this is the natural crossing point the
//   measurement itself produces, not a percentile picked to fit one
//   fixture.
//
//   agency IS computed and reported on every classified referent (below),
//   closing the "agency" third of the claim's own name — but it does NOT
//   gate the protogon decision above. Measured: at the mass this floor
//   requires, agency did not separate Kurtz (0.149) from an ordinary named
//   character — Frankenstein's own Victor sits LOWER, at 0.000. An honest
//   limit of what this signal can discriminate at this scale, disclosed
//   rather than smoothed over with a threshold that would only be fitting
//   one fixture's noise.
//
//   emanon is structural, not a threshold at all: every surface on the
//   real "creature" prior ("the creature", "the monster", "the wretch",
//   "my adversary", ...) fails the SAME capitalised-run shape
//   extractSurfaces itself already gates ordinary discovery on — this

//
// ROOT CAUSE THIS ANSWERS: discoveredCast/sessionReferents hard-scoped
// referent discovery to exactly one sourceId (`session.documents.get`),
// which is a property of the CALLER, not of discoverReferents itself —
// surfaces.js's own clustering (namesCorefer: containment or shared final
// token, the ENGINE-tier "NAME-variant coreference" its header declares,
// same doctrine that already merges "Victor Frankenstein" with
// "Frankenstein" within one document) never receives a document boundary as
// an argument. It clusters whatever flat surface list it is handed. Handing
// it ONE document's surfaces every time, with no caller ever pooling more
// than one, was the only reason two documents' variant name-forms for the
// same being never merged — not a missing capability, an unexercised one.
//
// This is name-variant coreference EXTENDED ACROSS documents, not a new
// identity mechanism: same `discoverReferents`, same `namesCorefer`, same
// generic-token fence, run once over the union of every named document's
// candidate surfaces instead of once per document. Two sources naming a
// being "Kade" and "Marcus Aurelius Kade" now corefer for the same reason
// "Frankenstein" corefers with "Victor Frankenstein" inside one book: a
// shared final token, structural, no witness needed (SEED.md "identity by
// consequence" is a different, deeper claim — CON · Pattern, requiring
// arrival-position evidence — and is untouched by this; this stays exactly
// on the SIG · Void · Tending cell discoverReferents already occupies).
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLOSE: two sources with NO shared or variant literal
// name form (a pure epithet with no name-token overlap, e.g. "the Iron
// Admiral" against "Kade") still will not merge — namesCorefer has nothing
// to compare. That is not a scoping bug; it is the tier boundary
// surfaces.js's own header already draws ("MODEL tier: descriptor synonymy
// ... NOT derivable, reported as a typed gap"). Closing that case needs a
// cross-document identity STATISTIC that does not exist in this repo yet
// (referents/consequence.js::identityByConsequence is the one non-string
// identity-comparison organ here, and it is not that statistic: it needs
// both surfaces inside one continuous openReading() state, and its own
// header already records "weak segregation power" on an ensemble cast where
// entities are rarely apart — the same weak-power failure mode reproduces
// when it is naively extended across concatenated documents).
