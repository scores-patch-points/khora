   * mean and variance. Destroyed: phase coherence, and with it time asymmetry
   * and intermittency. Two series can therefore be bit-identical in spectrum
   * and land on opposite sides of this ground — which is the entire reason it
   * is worth having, and is not reachable from `shuffle` at any draws.
   *
   * Hermitian symmetry is imposed rather than hoped for, so the output is real
   * by construction and not by rounding. DC keeps its value (it is the mean,
   * which is part of what is preserved) and, at even length, so does Nyquist —
   * that bin has no free phase, only a sign, and spending randomness on it
   * would be perturbing a magnitude while claiming not to.
   *
   * LICENSED FOR `irreversibility` ONLY. Amendment I: a perturbation admitted
   * on the strength of one statistic carries no ground for any other, and this
   * one was measured, not assumed. Against 96 real DNS lines
   * (scripts/turbulence-growth-rule.mjs) the growth rule's `level` test returns:
   *

   *   burstiness          unstable 91/96
   *   permutationEntropy  exceeds_witness 93/96
   *
   * The two failures are not noise and are worth keeping. `burstiness` is a max
   * over windows and phase randomisation preserves the variance, so the two
   * grounds sit almost on top of each other and the cross-measurement has no
   * footing — `unstable` is the correct answer, not a near miss.
   * `permutationEntropy` is censored because real turbulence is more ordered
   * than a spectrum-matched surrogate at every line, which is a finding about
   * the material rather than a placement of it. Only the arrow statistic

 * time — so "generate more candidates" becomes a mechanism for manufacturing
 * findings, and it reads as productivity. Nothing in the record would show it:
 * every surviving candidate cites a real ground, a real rank, a real spec.
 *
 * This is #3 at a grain the seed states only for a single arrival. A support
 * that the maximum of n draws clears by construction is a null of zero width
 * for the question actually being asked, even though it has perfectly good
 * width for the question it was built for.
 *
 * MEASURED, 2026-07-31, burstiness/shuffle over 400 iid values, draws=200,
 * window=8, 40 trials per row. Every "observation" is a statistic of perturbed
 * material — signal-free by construction, so a correct null places it uniformly
 * and the median rank should sit near 1/2:
 *
 *   n     median rank vs one-arrival   vs best-of-n   censored above (naive)
 *   1     0.633                        0.633          0%

 *   200   0.010                        0.573          25%
 *
 * At n=200 a one-arrival ground ranks pure noise at 0.010 and calls a quarter
 * of the trials surfeit outright. The corrected column stays near uniform
 * throughout. n=1 is identical in both columns, which is the identity the
 * suite asserts directly. Evidence: `conformance/extreme.test.js`.
 *
 * `n` IS NOT A FOURTH DECLARED NUMBER. It is counted, not chosen — the same
 * standing `extent` has: "the extent of the material is not among them. Whoever
 * hands material in has already declared it." Whoever hands in n observations
 * has likewise already declared n, and a caller that has to *pick* n has
 * misunderstood the call. Three declared numbers still.
 *
 * `direction` IS REQUIRED and is never defaulted. Amendment II: above and below
 * are both measurements and neither is the informative one. Pooling them would
 * be a two-sided test smuggled in under a one-sided name, and #6 refuses the
 * averaging of grounds. The extreme of n maxima and the extreme of n minima are
 * different nothings and this returns whichever was asked for.
 *
 * The result is the same shape `ground` returns, so `difference`, `volume`,
 * `admissible` and `keep` consume it unchanged — there is no second mechanism
 * here, only the same construction asked a question about n arrivals.

 * A difference that makes a difference.
 *
 * Did the figure move the next ground further than it would have moved anyway?

 * pattern, and it is extraction. Only widening is encounter.
 *
 * TWO CORRECTIONS LIVE HERE, found independently and both load-bearing. The
 * first is about the MAGNITUDE's null and extent; the second about the SIGN's.
 *
 * THE NULL MUST GROW THE WAY `after` GREW. This is the correction that cost the
 * most to find, so it is written down at length.
 *
 * SEED.md's statement of the null is "same spec, same material, fresh seed,"
 * and that is right for the case it was written for: two grounds over the SAME
 * material, where the only thing that moved them apart is the figure. But the
 * commonest real use is a reader accumulating material, where `after` is built
 * over MORE material than `before` — and burstiness is a max over windows, so
 * its expectation rises with extent for no reason but extent. Held at before's
 * n, the null then measures seed noise while `moved_by` measures seed noise
 * PLUS growth, and growth wins.
 *
 * What that looks like when you go and check: wired into atmosphere clearing,
 * this fired on homogeneous noise at almost exactly even spacing — boundaries
 * 28 apart, a clock, not a perception — and recovered 23 of Frankenstein's 24
 * chapter boundaries while ALSO recovering 21–23 of them from the same series
 * SHUFFLED. A statistic that scores the same on material whose order has been
 * destroyed is reading its own arithmetic. (scripts/two-clearings.mjs)
 *
 * So the null is grown to `after`'s extent by drawing from `before`'s own
 * material: the same regime, continued. Any displacement it shows is what
 * growth alone contributes, and `moved` is what survives subtracting it. This
 * is a CONDITIONAL null in the sense the lineage keeps having to relearn — it
 * varies along the exact axis the artefact exploits, where an unconditional one
 * is only a change of units. When the extents are equal it reduces to the
 * reseeding null with nothing added.
 *
 * `material` is BEFORE's own material, and that is checked rather than trusted:
 * handing in AFTER's material instead makes every null draw a sibling of
 * `after` — same material, different seed — so `moved` becomes a coin that
 * lands true about 1/(reseeds+1) of the time no matter what the material does.
 * That is a real bug this check was written to catch, and it caught one.
 *
 * AND THE SIGN IS OWED A NULL TOO. `opened` was a bare inequality,
 * volume(after) > volume(before) — measured, on real arrivals, to fall inside
 * this null 77.8% of the time, to flip on a mere reseed 41.1% of the time, and
 * to call an exact tie "extraction" 15.0% of the time. That is SEED.md #3 ("a
 * null of zero width is refused, everywhere, at every level") and #4 in the one
 * place the seed calls the whole physiology. So the sign is three-valued: a
 * gap is a result (#8), and "no sign sayable" is a real finding about this
 * arrival rather than a quiet vote for extraction.

  // 3·std of the SAME reseed samples clears 0.266 at every one of those
  // (reseeds, draws) pairs — the ceiling stops being a function of how many
  // reseeds happened to be declared. It costs precision at the margin: VOSS,
  // the fixture's genuinely-consequential surface, had a `moved_by` of 0.309
  // against a raw maximum of only 0.291 at the hand-tuned SPEC — a margin of
  // 0.018, thinner than KESTREL's own false positives were riding on, and

  // clears at that SPEC, though it still clears at others. SEED.md #3 makes
  // that the right side to be wrong on: a null of zero width — which is what
  // a systematically-low raw maximum amounts to — is refused, everywhere,

/**
 * The third use of the one operation: another figure's ground.
 *
 * Two figures are measured by the SAME observation against two different grounds.
 * The relationship between the grounds is determined by how differently the
 * observation ranks. If the observation is more extreme against the target ground
 * than the figure's own, the figure's ground is "above" (it constrains what can
 * be perceived). If less extreme, it's "below" (the target enables more). If the
 * displacement is negligible, the grounds are "peer" — no level exists between
 * them. This is the first sheath: identity by consequence, never by appearance.
 *
 * For the growth rule: a candidate organ is "above" the core if its observation
 * ranks higher (more extreme) against the core's ground than against its own —
 * the core's ground cannot anticipate what the organ perceives.
 *
 * THE THRESHOLD IS A RESOLUTION FLOOR, NOT A NULL, AND FOR A LONG TIME IT WAS
 * ASKED TO BE BOTH.
 *
 * `2/draws` is the finest rank difference two grounds can even express, so
 * nothing below it is sayable. That makes it necessary and it never made it
 * sufficient — and because it SHRINKS as draws grows, a caller who paid for
 * more resolution got a threshold approaching zero, which SEED.md #3 names as
 * the lineage's most expensive dead end: a null of zero width clears anything
 * put in front of it.
 *
 * Measured, on white noise coarsened to six scales (12 realisations, six
 * adjacent pairs each) — material with no scale structure whatsoever, where
 * every relation should be `peer`:
 *
 *   draws  threshold   laddered/5   above / below
 *      60     0.0333         3.08      21 / 16
 *     120     0.0167         3.42      19 / 22
 *     300     0.0067         4.33      27 / 25
 *     600     0.0033         4.42      26 / 27
 *
 * The direction is a coin flip at every setting, and the rate of finding a
 * level where none exists RISES with draws. This is the same defect, in the
 * same shape, that `pattern`'s `opened` sign carried until it was given a
 * reseeding null — recorded a few dozen lines above, at 77.8%.
 *
 * So the displacement gets the null the sign already got: how far does the
 * rank move on a MERE RESEED of own's own ground, same spec, same material,
 * fresh seed. Anything smaller is reseeding noise wearing a level's clothes.
 * No fourth declared number — `reseeds` is already the resolution of pattern.
 *
 * The null is OPTIONAL because a ground stores a fingerprint and an extent,
 * not its material, so `level` cannot reseed on its own. When it is not
 * supplied the result says so (`nulled: false`) instead of quietly presenting
 * a resolution floor as a null. Callers that can supply material should.
 *
 * Returns { relationship, displacement, threshold, floor, reseedNull, nulled,
 * rank, cross } or a gap.
