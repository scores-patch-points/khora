// native/eval/constitutional-read.mjs — the CONSTITUTIONAL reader, run as 6.1
// specifies it, from the v7 repo.
//
// READING-POLICY P0: "Read through the host session unless you are
// deliberately isolating one organ. Any claim about 'what this system can do'
// must name the assembly it was measured on." The assembly here is the
// LEGACY HOST — packages/host/corpus.js::discoveredCast via sessionReferents:
// surfaces -> witnessed referents -> pronoun binding -> relation vocabulary ->
// SVO triples — which V7-CUT's compatibility law explicitly keeps alive
// ("Existing 6.1 paths may survive as compatibility facades") while native
// re-earns each stage under conformance. This driver exists because the v7
// native path was being reported as "the reader" while missing P2 stages 4-8
// outright; the constitutional baseline must be RUNNABLE from this repo, not
// remembered.
//
// P3: priors are INJECTED, never derived, and every reported run states which.
// This driver injects the language prior (bin/priors/lang/en.json, via
// `language: "en"`) and the per-text coref prior when one exists for the
// source (pg84-frankenstein.coref.json — the human-curated "the creature"
// cluster; P3: "A result produced with an empty coref prior is a result about
// an unprimed reader").
//
// P2: "A run reports which it used; unused stages are not implied." The
// manifest below names stages run AND stages not run.
//
// P5.2: byte-offset self-verification is mandatory for anything that emits a
// seekable address — a sample of admitted spans is re-sliced and compared.
//
// Usage: node native/eval/constitutional-read.mjs <book.txt> [--coref <prior.json>] [--language en]
