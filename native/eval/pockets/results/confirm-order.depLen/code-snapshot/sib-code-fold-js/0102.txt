// fold-chat-answerwire.js — the seams between the chat (fold-chat.js run()) and the slot-ask pipeline (fold-chat-answerturn.js).
// No DOM, no clock of its own beyond a declared time box, NO MODEL. Everything here is a pure function or takes its network as an argument,
// so the chat's wiring is testable without a browser (fold-chat-answerwire.test.mjs):
//
//   slotTurnWanted(...)       may this turn try the slot pipeline at all? (the chat's kind/mode gate)
//   passagesForTurn(...)      the chat's read passages → the pipeline's passage shape (title, host, lang from what the page said it is)
//   slotDeps(...)             the deps runAnswerTurn needs, over ONE audited fetch (every outbound call is logged and abortable)
//   runSlotTurn(...)          runAnswerTurn under the turn's signal and a declared time box → { handoff } | AnswerTurn@1
//   endsTurn(turn)            does this result end the turn mechanically (no model call)?
//   storeAnswerTurn(turn)     the plain-JSON copy that rides message.answerTurn (survives a reload and a session merge)
//   answerLine(turn)          message.content for a slot turn: the realised answer line, or '' (a gap/contest is drawn, not said)
//   traceFeed(tt, turn, lineEvent)  one feed row per trace line of the turn
//   answerRecordNote(turn)    the short summary the "how this was answered" record carries, and its process line
//
// A slot turn is stored as `authored: "sources"` + `answerTurn` (never `snips`): its words are the source sentence's own words
// (fold-chat-strand.js contentAllowed checks that), so the model never speaks alone on it — it is not called at all.
