//   recallAsk(question)                 is the ask about what the FOLD ITSELF said before? → { about } | null.  English, DECLARED.
//   recallOf({ question, claims })      the claims it said (verbatim, at their addresses) → { turn, address, claims, text } | null
//
// The store (s.claims, fold-chat-record.js → khora FoldRecord@1) holds every sentence the fold spoke or showed, verbatim, at /t<turn>/c<i>.
// A repeat ask is a READ at an address (khora foldAt), never a lookup and never a rewrite: the words returned are the words said. With nothing
// stored, or nothing that bears on "about X", the result is null and the turn goes the normal way (it is never answered from a guess).
