// fold-chat-salience.js — what the model is handed is only what is SALIENT to THIS ask. Pure: no DOM, no IO, no model, no clock.
//
// "We need to feed the model only things that are salient." (user, 2026-10-06; memory `salient-only-prompt`). A small model is swamped by volume
// and by off-topic text, so every block of the per-message prompt has to earn its place against the CURRENT ask:
//
//   salientSources(passages, terms)    which pages, and which SENTENCES of them (verbatim slices, page order, within a character budget)
//   salientHistory(history, ...)       the earlier exchange, only when the ask CONTINUES the thread; a topic change hands the model none
//   salientSummary(summary, ...)       the discourse summary and the record, only the exchanges that bear on the ask and are not already verbatim
//   askTerms(...)                      the ask's content stems (its words minus the language's closed class) plus the carried referents
//
// FIND/SNIP, NEVER REWRITE: an excerpt is page.text.slice(start, end) pieces joined by " … " — `verifyExcerpt` re-derives it. Verification (the Pivot)
// still runs against everything READ; salience only chooses what the MODEL sees. Caseless, no capital letter is read; matching is stem-folded
// (fold-chat-ground.js tokenize/stemOf). A language with no closed-class prior has no content/function split: every selector then returns the input
// UNCHANGED with `measured: false` — a typed gap, never a guess.
