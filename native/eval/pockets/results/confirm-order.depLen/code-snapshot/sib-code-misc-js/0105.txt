// held-turns.mjs — A SLOW TURN IS HELD, NEVER PUNISHED (2026-09-22).
//
// The user: "Heimdall shouldn't punish us. It should just hold content as
// needed, creating a temporary cache for the requester." Before this, a turn
// that outlasted the deadline was aborted AND its model was dropped from the
// roster — measured live: one turn stuck reading 138K chars of web pages (the
// model never called) locked gemma2:2b out of a whole conversation.
//
// Now a turn runs to completion whatever the client does. Its result is held
// here, keyed by the requester and the exact request, so the same request
// again — or a poll of its receipt id — gets the finished answer instead of a
// second run. A failed turn is held as a failure (status + error ride the
// entry for its TTL window): asking again sees the error, and retries
// explicitly via takeHeld.
