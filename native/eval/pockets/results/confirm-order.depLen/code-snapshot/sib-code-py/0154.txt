"""Client for Nashville's ePAV "Metro Contract Document Search" portal at
documents.nashville.gov -- a genuinely separate system from Legistar, with
real historical depth back to at least the 1990s (Legistar's own floor is
2020-07-13). Confirmed against the live site 2026-09-25.

Field mapping (read off the live form's <label for="IndexN">, not guessed):
Index1 Contract Number, Index2 Contracting Party, Index3 Department or
Agency, Index4 Description, Index5 Keyword, Index6 Document Type. Index5
(Keyword) is confirmed broken server-side: a "Motorola" keyword search's own
top result (A-90-140, an EMBRAER hangar ground lease) does not contain the
word "Motorola" anywhere in its 127 pages. Index6 (Document Type) currently
has exactly one real option, EXECUTED CONTRACT -- every search here is
implicitly scoped to it. Department or Agency is the enumeration axis:
Contracting Party filters correctly too (verified: "MOTOROLA" returned 30
real, correctly-filtered rows spanning 1999-2009+) but requires already
knowing vendor names, so it's a drill-down tool, not a crawl strategy.

The site caps results at 1000 rows per search; a POLICE-only search (no
other filter) hit that cap live. iter_all() surfaces this to the caller
(logged to stderr) rather than silently returning a truncated set --
departments that hit the cap need a further split (e.g. by Contracting
Party prefix) not yet implemented here.

Some rows are not the original document at all: Metro Clerk destroys
records on schedule (Tennessee's GRS 102/RDA 287), and the "archived" file
for those is a one-page destruction notice, not the contract. Confirmed
live: contract 15387 (Police Dept, C&S Harley-Davidson, "MOTORCYCLE
MAINTENANCE") resolves, via its real row token, to a single page reading
"METRO CLERK / This record was destroyed per GRS 102/RDA 287." --
is_destruction_notice() names this so callers flag it distinctly instead of
mistaking a stub for a real archived contract.
