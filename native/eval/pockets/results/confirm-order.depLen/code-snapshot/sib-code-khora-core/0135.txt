// pipeline-run.mjs — THE ARBITRARY GENERATION PIPELINE, END TO END, EVERY
// STAGE ON THE RECORD. The nine stages (user, 2026-09-22), each proven by
// its own falsifier before the next was wired:
//
//   1 PROMPT     the ask, verbatim                       ("prompt")
//   2 VOID       the form gate + the void on every level ("register", "void")
//   3 SURF       seek across sources shaped like the void ("surf")
//   4 SHAPE      learn the form's shape; NO → SURF again  ("shape")
//   5 HUNT       ethos: what earns admission to the ground ("hunt", "ground")
//   6 SKELETON   the reason-linted composition            ("arrange")
//   7 SK. LOOP   recompose what a finding licenses, settle ("arrange")
//   8 PATHOS     additive passes until Gebser arrives     ("check", "arrive")
//   9 PIECE      the folded output, verdicts beneath it   ("piece")
//
// Each stage appends its own work product to an append-only ledger before the
// next stage runs, so a run killed at any boundary leaves everything up to
// that boundary readable, and `phase-report.mjs` lays the stages out in order.
// The floor stage matters most for that: once the draft exists, the piece
// already exists as the material's own sentences in the piece's order, and
// every model call after it can only improve on a product that is already
// true. Nothing here is specific to essays — the register decides the voice,
// the ground decides the parts, the ask decides which parts are drawn.
//
// Model calls go through the engine's own gated wire (`streamOllamaChat`),
// never a raw fetch: the safety-and-ethics gate sees every one.
