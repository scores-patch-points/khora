// hard-meaning.mjs — "meaning is having a hard time emerging", measured.
//
// The trigger half of the ant-swarm protocol: a turn is pointed at material
// that a plain reading cannot hold — garbled, truncated, degraded, dense,
// empty — so the reading must swarm instead of trusting one pass. Deterministic
// and mechanical, matching the repo's own discipline (no model call, no
// hand-set threshold that is not a declared floor): the detector names the
// signal that made meaning hard, and that type is what the content-rules
// ledger keys a standing rule on.
//
// Every signal is a FLOOR with a falsifying control (the wall II.23): a
// signal that fires on material a plain reading holds fine is a detector
// error, and the control that would prove it is the same counterfactual the
// ledger writes with the rule. The floors are conservative on purpose — a
// missed hard read costs a re-read, a false auto-route hijacks ordinary chat
// (measured failure mode of over-eager detectors, 2026-09-19) — so only
// unambiguous signals route.
