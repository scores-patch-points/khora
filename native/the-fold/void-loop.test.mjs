// void-loop.test.mjs — the DEF/EVA/REC loop against the REAL algebra.
//
// No stubs anywhere that matter: the cube is the engine's own, the grid is
// `makeGrid` bound to it, the space is `void-shape.js`, and every act the
// loop lands goes through the real `parseAct`/`land`. A refusal here is a
// refusal the real composition law produces.
//
// ENGINE PATH, disclosed rather than silently divergent: this file imports
// eoreader7's NATIVE kernel (`native/kernel/cube.js`, `native/kernel/
// task-log.js`), which is what `void-shape.test.mjs` — the module this one
// builds directly on — already imports, and what the repo's own
// "Retire the legacy engine.1: the-fold depends on eoreader7 alone" direction
// points at. `grid.test.mjs` still imports the frozen legacy engine path,
// which is an uninitialised submodule in this checkout, so that file cannot
// run here at all. One
// consequence of the native path is real and named: the native kernel
// exports no `checkCubeProgression`/`isCurrentOperator`, and `grid.js`
// already guards for exactly that (`foldGrid`'s `progression` falls back
// to `[]`), so nothing this file asserts depends on the progression check.
//
// The specimen is void-shape.test.mjs's own, reused verbatim rather than
// re-typed: "who was lincoln's vp?", answered "Hannibal Hamlin" on one
// draw and "Andrew Johnson" on the next, each true, neither the answer.
