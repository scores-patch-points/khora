// expertise.js — REC·Paradigm: A REVISABLE RECORD OF WHAT THIS ENGINE HAS
// LEARNED ABOUT A FORM, EVERY LINE TIED TO WHAT PRODUCED IT (2026-09-22).
//
// The user: "mint an archon for 'expertise' and consolidate all we've
// learned about how to understand a medium. we want to save a revisable EOT
// file on 'expertise' tied to what influenced it, and then task that archon
// … to go learn about things and record what it finds to that log … all
// provenance saved." This module is that record. It invents no new
// mechanism — it wires together what this session already built and what
// the engine already had:
//
//   the DEFINITION    learnParadigmEmergent / learnForm (paradigm.js,
//                      form-prior.js) — a form's shape, compressed, measured
//                      against a relative ground, nothing about the form
//                      written in.
//   THE REVISABLE LOG  document-ledger.js's own append-only ledger: an
//                      observation per learning pass, `kind` = the form's
//                      name, `supersedes` the observation it revises — the
//                      SAME discipline the generation pipeline's own ledger
//                      already uses for every other revisable fact. Nothing
//                      is edited; a later pass appends and points back.
//   PROVENANCE         every observation's `basis` names its sources (which
//                      corpus, how many instances, how many population,
//                      when) — read straight off learnParadigm's own
//                      `sources`/`instances`/`population` fields.
//   PROVISIONAL →      kernel/kind-universe.js's own store: a kind is
//   CORROBORATED       provisional on its first signing and confirmed once
//                      distinct sources corroborate it (CANONICALIZATION_
//                      FLOOR = 2) — the same machinery organs/mnemonic.js
//                      already uses for a taught image concept, applied here
//                      to a taught FORM. A later pass that finds the same
//                      form from a DIFFERENT source corroborates it; a pass
//                      whose measured shape genuinely disagrees is the
//                      caller's to falsify (falsifyOccurrence), never
//                      silently overwritten.
//
// A form's CURRENT expertise is the projection: its latest non-superseded
// observation. Everything before it stays on the ledger, on the record.
