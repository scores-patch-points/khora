// sandboxed-agent.js — an open-ended coding loop, like Claude Code itself,
// over runProxyTurn (the SAME grounded/checked/admission-gated model-calling
// pipeline every other request uses — never a raw Ollama call held apart in
// a client). code-loop.js's sibling, not its replacement: code-loop.js is
// for "make this real, on-disk file pass this real test command" (bounded,
// test-gated, physics-reverted). This is for "read, write, and run things
// freely while figuring out what to build" — the shape a general coding
// assistant actually needs, with NOTHING it touches able to reach the real
// machine at all.
//
// "Operate within the browser sandbox is the idea" (user direction): the-
// fold's own browser terminal (term.js/term-js-worker.mjs) already proved
// the shape — egress severed, a Worker with no real fs/child_process/
// network. This is that same shape, rebuilt natively in Node rather than
// requiring a browser tab: an in-memory virtual filesystem (nothing here
// EVER calls node:fs) and vm.Context-isolated JS execution (no `require`,
// no `process`, no `fs`, no network global — the identical severed-globals
// discipline term-js-worker.mjs states in its own header, applied via V8
// context isolation instead of Worker-thread global deletion). Because
// nothing here can touch the real machine, there is no safety reason to
// gate a write or a run behind a person's approval the way a REAL write/run
// would need (P24's own consent posture) — every action can run
// automatically, the same reasoning term.js's own AUTO_RUN_LANGS gives the
// runtimes it has proven fully severed.
//
// Mechanical action grammar, never a JSON tool call — code-loop.js's own
// stated principle ("ask the model for exactly ONE... mechanical action")
// extended from its two actions (read/patch) to five (read/write/list/run/
// done), because an open-ended loop needs to create files and execute code,
// not only patch an existing one. The loop serves the same received
// language knowledge as code-loop.js (generation briefs in turn 1,
// keyword refusal on write) — the write verb replaces whole files, so the
// patch-time FIND machinery has no seat here; the propose-time gate does.
//
// MOUTH-SEES-NAMES, BY DESIGN HERE: unlike the chat path (where the system
// never hands the mouth a filename), this loop's ACTION grammar REQUIRES
// paths — list shows names, read/write take PATH. That is the tool-door
// exception, the same shape as OpenCode/Claude Code's read/write verbs:
// the model must name what it touches to be auditable. The names are
// VIRTUAL (the in-memory Map, never real disk), every move is disclosed on
// onNote + rounds, and nothing here reaches the real machine.
