// native/the-fold/antistrauss.mjs — ANTIStrauss: the safety-and-ethics
// module for every model call in eoreader7.
//
// WHY THE NAME: "AntiStrauss" is the working label for this module. It is a
// gate, not a persona: no prompt is rewritten, no voice is borrowed, no
// output is styled. It reads the call, settles a verdict, and either lets it
// through or refuses it — mechanically.
//
// WHAT IT IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT:
//   * It IS a pre-call gate + post-call audit that runs on EVERY model call
//     that reaches Ollama from the proxy.
//   * It IS readable. There is no encryption anywhere in this module, by
//     design: a safety gate that cannot be read is not a safety gate — it is
//     a backdoor wearing a safety gate's name. Every rule, every threshold,
//     every binding is plain text here, and any coder can audit it.
//   * It IS connected to the physics (native/kernel/reaction.js). The
//     verdict layer is the engine's own reaction substrate — the same
//     presence-gated, one-hop, provenance-carrying circuit the kernel
//     measures in eval/the-fold/mechanical-reasoning.mjs. The gate is a
//     FILTER, not a generator: it never adds a word to a prompt; it only
//     settles whether a call contravenes the standing law.
//   * It is NOT an LLM judging its own prompt. The tier-1 scan is plain
//     regex over objective classes; the tier-2 settle is the substrate. No
//     model ever votes on whether its own call is safe.
//
// HOW IT IS WIRED — the places an answer-producing model call can leave
// this process:
//   1. proxy-runner.mjs::streamOllamaChat — the single choke point every
//      chat/composition/code turn streams through. gate() runs before the
//      upstream fetch (with { forceBlock: true }, so ER7_ANTISTRAUSS=off
//      NEVER opens this path); the output guard probes each chunk with
//      reviewBlock() and replaces contravening output with a refusal + note.
//      review() runs when the stream ends.
//   2. proxy-runner.mjs's discoverFraming call — routed through the same
//      gated stream instead of its raw upstream fetch (a third-party model
//      call that used to bypass the gate entirely).
//   3. native/organs/look.js::completeVision — the vision lane (wired
//      2026-09-20, falsification F1): gate() pre-fetch and reviewBlock() on
//      the output, route "vision", forceBlock always. A blocked prompt
//      throws ERR_ANTISTRAUSS_BLOCKED and the read discloses it as a
//      missing sense, never an answer.
// Any other answer-producing call that does not pass one of these three is
// a WIRING BUG.
//   The residency pings (keepResidentDuringSetup, keepModelHot, heimdall's
//   /api/chat probe) are NOT gated and are disclosed as such: they send a
//   fixed 1-token "OK" and carry no prompt content — a keep-alive, never an
//   answer. If a new ANSWER-producing call appears that is not routed through
//   streamOllamaChat, that is a WIRING BUG: this module is the gate, and the
//   gate must see every call. The import in proxy-runner.mjs is static, so
//   the proxy fails closed at boot if this module cannot load — never
//   silently un-gated.
//
// THE PHYSICS FIELD — the ground file antistrauss-physics.txt at the repo
// root. Its bytes are the substrate's charter: sha256 -> groundHash, and
// every law row is bound to that digest (ethos-in-the-core, kernel/
// hyperlexicon.js::licenseStanding). The file therefore AFFECTS THE FIELD:
// change the file and the ground changes; a hot process whose laws no longer
// match the new ground refuses closed (ungrounded) rather than running
// ungoverned. When the real physics spec lands, it replaces this file's
// placeholder content — loadPhysicsSpec() is the seam that consumes it.
