// void-spec-falsify.test.mjs — THE FIRST DEDICATED TEST OF void-spec.js
// (2026-09-21). The user, continuing the "how confident are we of the prior
// steps" audit onto the void-definition layer itself: "we need to know what
// the shape is of things that we think would satisfy. 'write a sonnet' /
// 'write a poem' / 'rite @ whiteppr' / 'wright an essay' all need to be
// deciphered as pointing at a referent of a type of thing that has a shape."
//
// void-spec.js had zero dedicated tests before this — only one indirect path
// through pipeline-run-falsify.test.mjs. This locks in what a live probe of
// the user's four examples actually showed (verified against the real
// functions below, not assumed), so the next layer builds on checked ground:
//
//   - topicOf and deriveField (kernel/register.js) already recognize "sonnet"
//     and "poem" as lyric signs, and "essay" as an exposition sign, with NO
//     typo tolerance on the noun itself — a garbled genre-noun ("sonnnet",
//     "eassy") gets exactly the same null as no noun at all.
//   - the verb ("write"/"wright"/"rite") is never inspected by deriveField,
//     so a verb typo is harmless by construction, not by any fuzzy match.
//   - topicOf only strips the verb-and-form scaffolding when an "on/about/of"
//     phrase follows it. A bare form-ask with no stated subject ("write a
//     sonnet") RETURNED the whole ask, verb included, as if the verb+form
//     text were itself the topic — a real, scoped gap in declareVoidSpec's
//     whole.slot. CLOSED 2026-09-22: no subject is null, stated [unmeasured].
//
// 2026-09-22, the gate (user: "we dont want a set of shapes pre-set" … "the
// prompt may say 'again' and that is a referent pointing to something that
// defines the shape"): candidateFormToken reads the form-word off the ask's
// grammar with no table; declareForm resolves it — an anaphor off this
// engine's own ledger (measured), else the received table (declared), else
// unmeasured with the form-word carried for SURF. Tested against real
// output, never assumed.
