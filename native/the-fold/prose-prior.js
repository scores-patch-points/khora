// prose-prior.js — a real, measured floor for "does this read as English
// prose," using the same medium-blind sedimented-prior machinery this
// project already proved on Bach (kernel/continuation.js;
// eval/the-fold/midi-continuation.mjs, 2026-09-02: a prior sedimented from
// what was heard predicts real continuation far better than a shuffled
// control, judged prequentially, in bits). No hand-typed theory of what
// code looks like — a word-level order-2 prior sedimented from a real prose
// corpus predicts real, unseen English far better than it predicts code,
// because code's own identifiers are almost entirely outside its
// vocabulary. Measured, not assumed: see this file's own ceiling below.
//
// Built 2026-09-25 for eot-draft.js's code-vs-prose block filter, whose
// existing signal (hard-meaning.mjs's garbled_token) needs >= 3 symbol-heavy
// tokens to fire and so stays silent on short code — a COUNT, blind to a
// short block. bitsPerWord is a RATE: it needs no minimum length to be
// honest, which is the whole reason to reach for it here.

// file, or so a caller with the document's own trusted prose wants that
// instead of a fresh read.
