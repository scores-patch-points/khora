// native/assemblies.js — the starting assembly registry
// (ASSEMBLIES-AND-ARTIFACTS.md §2's table, made a value; READING-SPEC S25).
//
// This file is the concrete half of kernel/assembly.js: which organs make up
// which assembly, at the adapter/host layer where assemblies live (A2.4 —
// the kernel is not an assembly, and kernel/assembly.js holds only the
// register mechanics). Organs are PATH STRINGS, never imports — declaring an
// assembly must not load one.
//
// The table is the starting registry, NOT a claim that these cuts are right:
// each boundary is a hypothesis, refutable per boundary by the severance
// test (A4.2 — spec step 6, not yet run; §9's P-a pre-registers that the
// dynamics row fails it, which is why that row is layer: "projection").
//
// CELLS ARE MEASURED, NOT ASSERTED. Each assembly's cells list the
// (operator, grain) pairs its organs' own eoOperation calls emit — read off
// the code (surfaces.js CELL = SIG·Ground; revision.js INS·Ground/Figure +
// CON·Figure; identity.js CON/SEG·Figure, DEF·Figure, REC·Figure) — and
// contract.ops/terrains/stances are derived from them by cellOf, never
// hand-typed (kernel/assembly.js's own rule).
//
// A FINDING, recorded here rather than silently edited away: the spec's §2
// table gives the entity assembly the terrains "Entity, (Void for its
// refusals)", but the identity organs it lists EMIT cells whose terrains the
// cube derives as Link (CON/SEG·Figure) and Lens (DEF/REC·Figure) — terrain
// is derived from an operator's domain, not from an assembly's subject. The
// contract below declares the measured union, and whether identity's
// CON/SEG/DEF/REC belong to entity or to link is exactly the kind of
// boundary question the severance test exists to settle (step 6, with
// predictions frozen first). Until it runs, the measured truth is declared
// and the table's narrower claim is kept visible in this comment.
