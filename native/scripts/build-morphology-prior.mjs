// build-morphology-prior.mjs — rebuild MorphologyPrior@1 from UniMorph.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The shipped prior's own provenance named
// `scripts/build-morphology-prior.mjs` and that file was NOT in this
// repository, with an `input` path pointing at a previous session's scratch
// directory. So the prior could not be rebuilt, only replaced — which means a
// hole in it could not be corrected. That is the finding S58 was written
// around, and committing the builder is what closes it.
//
// WHAT IT KEEPS, and why the artifact is small. UniMorph English is 652,477
// (lemma, form, tags) rows. A regular inflection is recovered at read time by
// `morphology.js`'s own suffix rule, so storing it would be storing what the
// reader can already derive: only the IRREGULAR TAIL is kept — a form whose
// lemma the suffix rule cannot reach. That is why 224,550 verb pairs reduce to
// ~5,500 entries, and the ratio is reported on every build rather than
// assumed.
//
// THE HOLE IT CANNOT CLOSE, measured and disclosed rather than worked around:
// UniMorph English carries **zero rows for the lemma `be`**, while every other
// top-frequency irregular (have, do, go, say, get, make, know, take, see,
// come, think, give) carries five verb rows apiece. The three rows in which
// `am`, `are` and `were` appear at all are tagged `N;SG` — the noun senses.
// A second named giver closes it: `adapters/text/priors.js`'s
// `COPULA_PARADIGM`, injected as `createLemmatizer`'s `supplement`. This
// builder does NOT fold that in, because an artifact naming UniMorph as its
// giver must contain what UniMorph gave and nothing else.

// `d` rule, a narrower `es`) produced a materially different artifact.
