// native/scripts/check-no-legacy-submodule.mjs — guard against reintroducing
// a dependency on the legacy-eoreader6.1 submodule.
//
// 2026-09-10: legacy-eoreader6.1's real engine modules, data fixtures, and
// scripts were migrated out (into native/adapters/text/, native/legacy-ported/,
// native/eval/fixtures/, native/priors/, cli/priors/) — see eoreader7/CLAUDE.md
// for the full record of what moved where and what was deliberately left
// behind, disclosed. This script greps the tracked source tree for the
// string "legacy-eoreader6.1" and fails loudly if a new reference shows up
// outside the allowlist below, so a future session (human or AI) does not
// silently grow a new dependency on a submodule this repo is retiring.
//
// 2026-10-02: the frozen eoreader6.1 provider is retired permanently. The
// fold's compatibility mount was scrubbed on 2026-10-01 (the-fold commit
// 8fe7d9d) and its restore attempts (#192/#193) were closed, not merged. So
// this guard also refuses the ways the frozen provider could be re-mounted
// under a new name: a sibling path, a live import, a runtime path join, the
// eoreader6.1-RETIRED mount directory, or the restore's own branch/framing.
// Those markers are a hard fail with no allowlist — historical COMMENTS about
// the retirement are permitted, and none of them match these patterns.
//
// Run as part of `npm test` (wired into native/package.json's "test" script
// and the root package.json "test" script, which CI runs) or standalone:
// node native/scripts/check-no-legacy-submodule.mjs
