// eoreader7 · build-construction-prior — Universal Dependencies CoNLL-U in,
// ConstructionPrior@1 out: the CONDITIONING LEVEL the form-level POS prior
// reads past.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, stated precisely so the existing prior is not maligned.
// scripts/build-pos-prior.mjs (the legacy engine.1) is faithful to its own stated
// discipline — "AMBIGUITY IS PRESERVED, NEVER RESOLVED... a form keeps every
// UPOS tag the treebank ever gave it, with real counts, never collapsed to
// one majority verdict here." That is right, and this file does not change
// it. The gap is not that the superposition was destroyed. It is that the
// VARIABLE THAT WOULD COLLAPSE IT was not kept: CoNLL-U's columns are
// ID FORM LEMMA UPOS XPOS FEATS HEAD DEPREL DEPS MISC, and the form-level
// prior keeps `form -> {UPOS: count}` alone. So `had` is held, correctly, as
// {AUX: 154, VERB: 335} — and nothing downstream has anything to collapse it
// WITH, which is how a consumer ends up collapsing it globally with one `>`
// (measured: native/eval/results/being-superposition-RESULTS.md).
//
// WHAT IS KEPT, AND WHY IT IS OBSERVABLE AT READ TIME. HEAD and DEPREL are
// the treebank's own answer, but they are a PARSE — unavailable when reading
// raw prose, so a prior keyed on them could never be consulted. What IS
// observable in raw text is the local frame, so this prior conditions a
// form's tag distribution on the DOMINANT CLASS OF THE FOLLOWING TOKEN,
// itself read from the form-level tally. That is enough for the distinction
// that broke the gate: "had been" (next token dominantly AUX) against "had
// sufficient" (next token dominantly ADJ) — auxiliaryhood is constructional,
// not lexical, and the construction's observable trace is what follows.
//
// SCOPED TO WHERE THERE IS SOMETHING TO COLLAPSE. The conditional layer is
// built ONLY for forms the treebank tags with more than one class. An
// unambiguous form has no superposition to collapse and would only inflate
// the file. This is a declared scope, not a coverage claim.
//
// THE FLOOR IS DECLARED AND CITED. A (form, nextClass) cell is kept only at
// >= MIN_OBSERVATIONS. One observation is not a distribution; 2 is the same
// structural minimum emergence/binding.js already uses for co-arrival ("one
// arrival has no co-arrival to test"), reused rather than re-derived.
//
// This is NOT a tagger and nothing here runs inference on our text — the
// same standing build-pos-prior.mjs states. It tallies a human-annotated
// gold treebank and never sees our documents at build time.
