// kernel/prior-query.js — THE MEANING POTENTIAL QUERY (Halliday). Staging is
// never limited to our sidecar: it is a query over the whole meaning
// potential — every prior in the house that carries knowledge of a genre,
// a medium, or a shape. The cascade:
//   1. the genre sidecar (FortunePrior) — accumulated staging per genre×medium×shape
//   2. the genre-tagged priors (NeedPrior@1) — the genre's meaning-cells and works
//   3. the reading priors (ReadingPriors@1, FoldReadingPrior@1) — the axioms
//   4. the record's own seams (always available — the generic staged pipeline)
//   5. the web (the hunt) — when the egress is open
// Each contributor is named with its provenance; the query is OPEN — a new
// prior family is registered, never a new branch.
//
// Handle: Bayes — after asking what is already believed before generating
// from nothing. NOT a claim of calibrated probability: this module never
// computes a posterior or a likelihood ratio (organs/corroboration.js
// already drew that line — "the witness's true p(yes|true)/p(yes|false)
// have not been measured, and inventing them would be worse than unit
// steps"). Bayes's actual job is narrower and honest: consult every real
// prior family this house has (native/kernel/rhythm-priors.js/Tala for
// WHEN, native/kernel/experience-priors.js/Vasana for residual cross-work
// impressions, this cascade for genre/staging via live_priors/derived-priors)
// BEFORE a caller falls back to a hand-written template — never silently
// skip the asking. Registered 2026-09-17 (archon-bayes-priors) after a
// "write me a sonnet" request was answered from register.js's VOICE_BY_FIELD
// template alone, though this exact cascade — with one real "lyric" entry
// already in the sidecar — sits one function call away. Amendment XVII.

/**
 * queryMeaningPotentialWithResonance(register, { topic, ...opts }) — the

 * with the void's own declared TOPIC (WHAT it is about), by real embedding
 * similarity — orthogonal to items 1-3 above, which key on genre alone
 * (HOW a genre stages) and would substring-match nothing for a topic.
 * "the query is OPEN — a new prior family is registered, never a new
 * branch" (this file's own header) — registered here as a NEW, separate,
 * async function rather than a change to queryMeaningPotential itself,
 * because that function is called SYNCHRONOUSLY by its one known live
 * production site (proxy-runner.mjs's composition planning), and changing
 * its own contract without verifying that call site live is a risk this
 * pass does not take. Wiring THIS function into that live call site
 * (which would mean making it await-aware there) is a disclosed, real,
 * deliberately unattempted next step — not silently implied done.
 *
 * Omitting `topic` degrades to EXACTLY queryMeaningPotential's own output,
 * evidence array untouched — pinned in prior-query.test.mjs. An
 * unreachable embedding service degrades the SAME way (a caught, silent
 * absence of this one contributor), matching every other contributor
 * above's own posture: a missing corpus fails to empty evidence, never to
 * a thrown turn.
 *
 * `livePriorsRoot` is DELIBERATELY a separate parameter from `liveDir`,
 * caught before this shipped by checking the real corpus rather than
 * assuming: `livePriorsDir(liveDir)` resolves to `live_priors/derived-
 * priors` (this cascade's own directory — arc-priors/need-priors/reading-
 * priors), which is NOT where live_priors' own content CATEGORIES live
 * (01-literature-books, 06-government-legal, ... sit one level ABOVE
 * derived-priors, in live_priors itself). Defaults to deriving that root
 * from `liveDir`'s own convention (its parent directory) rather than a
 * second hardcoded path, but is overridable when a caller's `liveDir`
 * does not follow that convention (e.g. a test fixture).
