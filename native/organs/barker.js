// organs/barker.js — BARKER, the arch: kinds of measured systems, candidate arches across them, and the
// instruments that decide whether either may be believed. Pure (no fs, no fetch, no model); profiles are injected.
// Handle: Barker — after Cory David Barker (Archdisciplinary Research Center), who compares unification metatheories for what persists across them; here the same question put to measured systems, and to this map itself: coordinated, never outside. Amendment XVII.

// ═══ PRE-REGISTRATION (FOLD-CONSTITUTION II.5) ═════════════════════════════════
// Written BEFORE the first run of any line below. Nothing here is tuned after a result; a prediction that
// fails is reported as failed; a bug found later is fixed in code, listed in the report that accompanies the
// run, and NO declared constant, rule or prediction below is changed after a result is seen. The sha256 of
// this leading comment block (eval/competence/lib.mjs::headerDigest) is what a card stamps as prereg_sha256.
// Consistent with docs/BARKER.md (revised 2026-10-05, sections 3-8 and 11); where they differ, THE CODE AND
// THIS HEADER WIN and the difference is listed under LIMITS.
//
// DISCLOSURE. Before this header was written the author read docs/BARKER.md in full and the source of
// kernel/{kind-induction, entity-kind-induction, kind-functional-induction, rng, nullcheck}.js and
// organs/{kind-standing, signal, frame}.js and the earned-cast ban lists. Nothing in this file had been run.
// Numbers about the inducer's behaviour on structureless input (BARKER.md 2.4) are the architect's and are
// NOT reproduced or relied on here. The booklet (FoA) was not re-read for this module; nothing from it is
// reproduced; page numbers live in BARKER.md Appendix A.
//
// WHAT THIS MODULE CLAIMS (and what it does not).
//   It claims to be a CALIBRATED INSTRUMENT, not a finding. Concretely, on PLANTED worlds built here:
//   (C1) the kind pipeline (Kanada, characteristic sets, a spectral splitter, under ONE search-aware
//        ceiling over several block-preserving nulls, then a unimodality discriminator) detects a planted
//        discrete kind that spans lineages when the planting is strong and wide, returns nothing on a
//        block-permuted copy of the same matrix, and does NOT call a planted correlated CONTINUUM a CLUSTER
//        more often than the exact binomial bound allows (it calls it GRADIENT, or nothing);
//   (C2) the arch engine (the persistence rule of BARKER.md 4.6) labels a planted cross-lineage regularity
//        PERSISTENT when the layout can support it, labels a regularity carried by one lineage FAMILY-BOUND,
//        labels nothing on shuffled data, and says UNDERPOWERED BY REACHABILITY when too few lineages can
//        vote (which, on the real 33-system layout of 9 lineages, 8 of them single systems, is expected);
//   (C3) every verdict function (minimumEffectVerdict, persistence, powerTrio) can pass AND fail on planted
//        effects of known size in its own units, and an unlicensed bridge can never return REFUTED.
//   It claims NOTHING about languages, code or notation, and nothing about EO. It is the thing eval/barker/*
//   points at those with. A result produced by it is a claim about the systems measured, in the units of the
//   statistic, relative to a registered smallest effect of interest, and never "a universal".
//
// DEFINITIONS.
//   system      one measured symbolic system; the unit of induction. LINEAGE (answer key; 9 for the real
//               layout) is the unit of INDEPENDENCE; BRANCH (13) is the unit of BLOCKING. Neither is ever a feature.
//   profile     SystemProfile@1 (BARKER.md 3.1): cells {id, group, channel, value, n, ci95, resamples,
//               definitionId, builder, giver, floor}; EO-free (assertEoFree); frozen; content-hashed.
//   block matrix  n systems x F features. Each feature is ONE BLOCK: a bin label per system (cut at the median
//               of the reference systems, tercile for 3 bins; ties go to the lower bin) plus the stability
//               weight c = number of the cell's resamples that fall in the system's own bin (1 when none).
//               The signature `feature=bin` has evidence count c, so activity = 1 + ln c, as the inducer reads
//               it. Every null moves WHOLE BLOCKS (bin and weight together); a redeal that gives one system two
//               bins of one feature, or none, is a bug and is unit-tested against.
//   instruments  I1 Kanada (kernel/entity-kind-induction.js::induceEntityKindCandidates): T_K = largest margin
//               (observed binding energy minus the (1-alpha) quantile of random subsets of ITS OWN size) over
//               candidates the inducer itself marks stable, never over a fallback nomination, with at most
//               floor(n/2) members (a larger basin is judged as its complement), 0 when there is none.
//               I2 characteristic sets (kernel/kind-functional-induction.js::characteristicSetKinds, inner
//               draws declared): T_C = largest lift over licensed kinds with 4..floor(n/2) members, 0 if none.
//               I3 spectral splitter (Barker-owned): T_S = sigma_1^2 / sum sigma_k^2 of the column-centred,
//               column-standardised dense 0/1 matrix; kind = the smaller side of the sign split of the first
//               left singular vector.
//   nulls       N-feat  every block permuted across systems independently (marginals and one-hot kept).
//               N-cov   Gaussian copula: real marginals, real correlation (normal scores, Ledoit-Wolf analytic
//                       shrinkage toward identity), n iid rows, mapped back through the empirical quantiles,
//                       binned with the SAME cuts (weights borrowed from the nearest real value).
//               N-cov1  one-factor model (principal factor + independent residual variances), unshrunk.
//               N-fam   blocks permuted only within the branch stratum; every single-system branch is pooled
//                       into ONE stratum "singletons"; informative for a kind only if >= 4 of its members sit
//                       in multi-system branches, else typed fam_uninformative.
//               N-curve Curveball trades on a presence matrix (row and column sums kept; within strata when
//                       strata are given); defined ONLY for presence matrices, never for one-hot blocks.
//   ceiling     for each null v and draw d: M_v(d) = max over instruments of z_i(d) = (T_i(d) - mu_iv)/sigma_iv
//               (mu, sigma over that null's draws; sigma floored at 1e-9). Ceiling_v = (1-alpha) quantile of M_v.
//               A candidate with statistic T found by instrument i has z = (T - mu_iv)/sigma_iv and
//               p_v = (1 + #{d: M_v(d) >= z})/(D+1). It is ABOVE THE CEILING iff, for every null that was run
//               except N-fam, z > Ceiling_v and p_v <= alpha. Adding an instrument or a null can only raise
//               the bar; there is no switch to opt out.
//   gap test    separating coordinate u (contrast axis for Kanada and characteristic-set kinds; first left
//               singular vector for spectral); Hartigan dip of u (the minimum over unimodal CDFs, with an atom
//               allowed at the mode, of the sup-norm distance to the empirical CDF; no tuning parameter);
//               p_dip = (1 + #{N-cov draws whose top-ranked candidate of the SAME instrument has dip >= observed})
//               /(D+1), the axis re-derived inside each draw (draws with no candidate use the first spectral axis).
//   labels      REFUSED (a control survived; the copula calibration was rejected; the basin is the whole
//               population; no N-cov null was run) > not above the ceiling (not reported as a kind) >
//               GRADIENT (above the ceiling, p_dip > alpha) > FAMILY-BOUND (smaller side spans < 3 lineages after
//               its largest branch is dropped, or the kind loses to an INFORMATIVE N-fam) > CLUSTER (cross-lineage).
//   coupling    the organ's own generic arch family (the per-card arches A01-A13 live in eval/barker/induce.mjs):
//               for two features in DIFFERENT feature groups, the nested (system -> branch -> lineage) mean of
//               the product of their normal scores; oriented by the sign of the pooled mean. The scan is
//               search-aware: the ceiling is the (1-alpha) quantile of the MAXIMUM |pooled mean| over all
//               cross-group pairs under the null; the nulls move whole GROUPS (N-grp over all systems, N-fam within
//               branch strata), so within-group structure (compositional shares, Zipf/Heaps) cannot manufacture a pair.
//   persistence BARKER.md 4.6 exactly as implemented in persistence(): h_l = 1 iff theta_l - median(null_l) > 0
//               on a lineage whose planted power at 2*SESOI (at ITS OWN composition) is >= 0.8; undefined
//               lineages leave the denominator; the sign gate is reachability(n_l); the pooled interval is a
//               lineage-cluster bootstrap whose LOWER bound must exceed SESOI; PERSISTENT needs every gate;
//               PERSISTENT-OUTSIDE-IE is the same over the non-Indo-European lineages alone.
//   verdicts    minimumEffectVerdict implements BARKER.md 6.0 (and review amendment F5: an unlicensed bridge
//               can pass as SURVIVES with bridge:"unlicensed" and leaves the headline, and a failure becomes
//               WEAKENED with bridge:"failed", never REFUTED).
//
// CONTROLS BUILT TO FAIL (II.23).
//   K1  the whole kind pipeline on `controlReps` (3) block-permuted copies of the same matrix: INSTRUMENT_FAILED
//       iff the number of copies with a surviving kind is rejected as <= alpha by the exact one-sided binomial
//       test (2 of 3 rejects; 1 of 1 would). No kind is reported from a failed instrument.
//   K2  copulaCalibration: the whole pipeline on W-copula worlds carrying the real correlation and marginals and
//       no cluster; INSTRUMENT_FAILED iff the any-kind rate is rejected as <= alpha (16 of 200).
//   K3  W-continuum: one latent coordinate, no gap, correlation matched to the planted kind world in closed form
//       (matchedLoading); the call must be GRADIENT or nothing.
//   K4  coupling scan on `controlReps` N-grp-permuted copies: same binomial rule.
//   K5  the sample-level self-tests of BARKER.md 7 exist as hooks on every result (resample, permute, rerun).
//
// POWER CHECKS.
//   powerGrid plants W-kind and W-continuum on the supplied layout over strength x signatureCount; a cell is
//   ADMISSIBLE iff W-kind power >= 0.8 AND the continuum false-CLUSTER rate is not rejected as <= alpha AND the
//   continuum call is GRADIENT or nothing. A statement of absence is licensed only if the SESOI cell (a kind of
//   >= 4 systems in >= 3 lineages carried by >= 12 signatures at strength >= 0.5) is admissible; otherwise it is
//   UNDERPOWERED, never "not found". powerTrio plants 2s, 0.5s, s and 0.1s at ten times n for every verdict
//   function: SURVIVES >= 0.8 at 2s; REFUTED >= 0.8 at 0.5s; neither more often than alpha at exactly s; not
//   SURVIVES at 0.1s with huge n. archPowerCard plants a coupling at 2s and 0.5s on the layout; lineageSignPower
//   decides, BEFORE any real data, which lineages can vote at all.
//
// PASS RULES (implemented as written in the functions named).
//   reachability(U): the smallest attainable sign p is 2^-U; alpha is reachable only for U >= 5; passing counts
//   U = 9: 8, 8: 7, 7: 7, 6: 6, 5: 5, 4 or fewer: unreachable.
//   Holm applies to pooled-effect tests only; the sign test is a replication GATE at alpha, not a significance claim.
//   A kind is SESOI-sized iff >= 4 systems, >= 3 lineages, >= 12 signature features with member-vs-rest prevalence
//   contrast >= 0.5 (contrast rule PROVISIONAL).
//
// TYPED NUMBERS (P4: a bare integer is provisional; each says what would derive it).
//   ALPHA 0.05 (repo-declared, equal to adapters/text/keyness.js KEY_ALPHA, asserted by test); SEED 20261005; DRAWS 999.
//   bins 2 (median split; 3 = terciles as sensitivity) PROVISIONAL: the bin count maximising held-out kind stability.
//   minKindSize 4 (the registered smallest kind). Kanada `permutations` 64 and `neighborCount` the organ's own
//   ceil(sqrt n), sweep 2..6 reported as sensitivity (a count that moves with the knob is an artifact); characteristic-set
//   inner draws 19 (the smallest declared count whose p floor 1/20 can reach alpha); controlReps 3.
//   core-signature contrast 0.5 PROVISIONAL. Planted worlds: 10 common features (one shared factor, loading 0.5),
//   60 noise features, kind size max(4, round(n/4)), in-branch kind size 4, branch-genealogy share of the
//   branch-variant continuum 0.6, all PROVISIONAL (BARKER.md 4.4 states the others). Coupling SESOI 0.30
//   (Cohen medium; PROVISIONAL until signed; the per-card SESOIs of BARKER.md 4.7a are registered in induce.mjs).
//   bootstrap B 2000; lineage power reps 200; feature coverage floor 0.5 of the systems (a feature defined in fewer
//   is dropped and typed; PROVISIONAL: the smallest coverage at which the bin cut is stable). N-fam is informative for
//   a kind at >= 4 members in multi-system branches (the registered smallest kind). Numerical constants
//   (power-iteration 300 steps, 1e-10; jitter 1e-6) are not statistical choices.
//
// RECORDED PREDICTIONS (before any run; the architect's guesses, so that surprise is measurable).
//   P1 block integrity holds under every redeal (feat, fam, cov, cov1, curve): 1.00 (deterministic; a failure is a bug).
//   P2 dipStatistic: 1/(2n) on an equally spaced sample, 0.25 on two equal atoms, both within 1e-6: 0.90.
//   P3 planted W-kind at strength 0.8 with 24 signatures on the real 33-system layout, D = 39: CLUSTER with F1 >= 0.9
//      against the cross-lineage kind in at least 2 of 3 replicates: 0.60. At strength 0.3 with 6 signatures: in at most 1 of 3: 0.90.
//   P4 the matched W-continuum at (0.8, 24): CLUSTER false-call rate <= 2 of 12 worlds: 0.75; at least one GRADIENT call in 12: 0.50.
//   P5 block-permuted copies of the strong kind world yield no surviving kind in at least 5 of 6: 0.85.
//   P6 coupling arch, toy layout 8 lineages x 5 systems, planted correlation 0.8 between two features of different
//      groups: standing PERSISTENT: 0.60. The same coupling carried by one lineage only: not PERSISTENT: 0.95.
//      Shuffled data: no PERSISTENT: 0.95.
//   P7 coupling arches on the REAL layout (branch sizes 9,7,4,3,2,1x8; lineages as in BARKER.md 2.1): every one
//      UNDERPOWERED by reachability (fewer than 5 lineages can vote at 2*SESOI): 0.95.
//   P8 minimumEffectVerdict: an unlicensed bridge never returns REFUTED: 1.00. powerTrio on a normal-mean world:
//      P_up, P_down hold; tiny and exactly-s rates not rejected as <= alpha: 0.90.
//
// ADDENDUM A1 (2026-10-05). Written AFTER the first exploratory smoke on PLANTED worlds, BEFORE tests/barker-organ.test.js existed, and before any real data.
//   SEEN (scratch scripts, not kept): (a) on the real layout (33 systems; 118 features, 48 of them signature, 60 noise) the three-instrument menu found NO planted kind,
//   not even at strength 0.8 with 24 signatures per kind. Kanada at its own defaults returned ONE basin holding the whole population (neighborCount ceil(sqrt n) = 6), so it
//   was inert there (and slow: the kernel's standardParameters is quadratic in the basin). The spectral share T_S is second order and cannot exceed the one-factor null N-cov1,
//   which reproduces the first factor, noise-inflated when n << p. (b) A greedy affinity-growth search localised the planted kind (F1 0.9 to 1.0) and cleared N-feat and N-cov;
//   it cleared N-cov1 only at n = 100 with strength 0.95 and a kind holding 40 percent of the systems; at n = 33 and n = 60 it did not clear N-cov1. (c) The dip of a contrast axis
//   is bimodal by selection; its null (which pays for the selection) is the right comparison, and a planted 26-percent kind did NOT beat it while a 40-percent kind did.
//   CHANGED: I4 `grow` (greedy affinity growth, defined at its function) joins the menu, default menu [kanada, charset, spectral, grow]; it is judged under the SAME ceiling, so it can
//   only raise the bar. A2 (made while writing the arch engine, same day): persistence() treats a control that was not run as UNDERPOWERED, never as passed, and tries the
//   non-Indo-European reading for every outcome except INSTRUMENT_FAILED, TRIVIAL and CHANNEL-BOUND. A3 (same day, after the first test run): candidates from different instruments whose
//   member sets overlap with Jaccard >= 0.8 are ONE kind (typed, PROVISIONAL; the instrument with the larger standardised statistic names it, and foundBy lists them).
//   NOT CHANGED: the nulls, the ceiling, alpha, the labels, the dip, SESOIs, N-cov1 (unshrunk, as BARKER.md specifies). PREDICTION P3 above is FALSE for the three-instrument menu at the
//   real layout and is reported so; for the four-instrument menu it is to be measured by powerGrid, not asserted. Proposal for the architect: at n = 33 the unshrunk N-cov1 is the
//   binding constraint on every kind (its first factor is noise-inflated); a bias-corrected one-factor variant (random-matrix inverse of the eigenvalue inflation) is a candidate
//   sensitivity, NOT implemented, because it would change the registered null.
//   TEST WORLDS (chosen after the exploration above, so they test the MACHINERY, not power at the real layout; the real-layout power is for powerGrid to report):
//     TOY-K100  4 branches x 25, one lineage each; strength 0.95; 24 signatures per kind; 10 noise, 4 common; planted kind of 40 systems; instruments spectral and grow; nulls feat, cov, cov1, fam; D = 39.
//     TOY-C60   the matched continuum on 4 x 15 (both variants, 2 seeds each); same menu and nulls; D = 39.     TOY-NULL  block-permuted copies of TOY-K100.
//     TOY-ARCH  8 lineages x 5 systems, two feature groups of 9, a planted correlation of 0.8 between one feature of each (and the same carried by one lineage only; and shuffled data).
//   RECORDED PREDICTIONS for them (before they were run): A1.P1 TOY-K100 is called CLUSTER with F1 >= 0.9 against the planted kind in at least 2 of seeds {1,2,3}: 0.80.
//   A1.P2 TOY-C60 yields no CLUSTER and no FAMILY-BOUND in any of its 4 worlds: 0.85. A1.P3 at least 2 of 3 block-permuted copies yield no kind: 0.90. A1.P4 every pure-function test
//   (dip, binomial rules, reachability, nested means, bootstrap, ARI, agglomeration, verdict table, persistence table, audit, EO-free scan) passes at the FIRST run: 0.70.
//   A1.P5 TOY-ARCH: planted coupling PERSISTENT: 0.60 (P6 above); carried by one lineage: not PERSISTENT: 0.95; shuffled: no PERSISTENT: 0.95.
//
// SOURCE RULES (scanned by tests/barker-organ.test.js).
//   No LLM, embedding, network, fs or process access anywhere in this file. No EO module is imported and no EO
//   vocabulary appears in any profile it accepts. The only kernel organs imported are kernel/rng.js,
//   kernel/nullcheck.js, kernel/entity-kind-induction.js, kernel/kind-induction.js,
//   kernel/kind-functional-induction.js and organs/kind-standing.js. A candidate the inducer flags as a
//   fallback nomination is excluded wherever candidates are read. No description-length or parameter-count
//   penalty and no MDE-as-threshold appears: SESOIs are registered, never read off the instrument.
//
// LIMITS stated before any run.
//   N-cov and N-cov1 model dependence as Gaussian/one-factor; the t-copula (df 4) is a printed sensitivity only.
//   Charset kinds on one-hot data license nothing unless rows repeat (reported, not hidden). Kanada's own
//   internal null makes T_K censored at 0 on most draws; the p-value is rank-based so this costs power, not validity.
//   The dip null uses the top-ranked candidate of the same instrument. 9 lineages (8 single systems) make the
//   sign gate nearly unreachable for per-lineage regularities: UNDERPOWERED is the expected common result.
//   The notion of "arch" implemented here is cross-lineage persistence of a statistic; FoA's arches are claims
//   about frameworks, and an operationalisation can be a strawman (BARKER.md R9). The map is itself coordinated:
//   every output carries its own frame declaration and self-test hooks and claims no standpoint outside.

 * `opts`: groups, bins, draws, alpha, seed, instruments, nulls, minKindSize, controlReps, branchOf, lineageOf (answer keys; default labels.branch/lineage), ieLineages,
 * powerGrid (from powerGrid()), calibrations ({ group: copulaCalibration() }), archPower (from archPowerCard()), arches (default true), concatenated (default true),
 * agreementDraws (199), reference (training system ids for the bin cuts). The map is itself coordinated: the result carries its own frame declaration and self-test hooks.
