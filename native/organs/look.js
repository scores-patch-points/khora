// look.js — the native "looking" capacity: when the reader is reading
// something wrong, LOOK at it. Two senses, the same way this project's own
// corroboration/witness machinery requires elsewhere:
//
//   1. A MECHANICAL sense: OpenCV box/connector detection + per-region
//      Tesseract OCR, landing detected structure as addressed observations
//      (the EOT ledger lines visual-rec.mjs already writes, re-exported
//      here so the proxy reads ONE seam, not two).
//   2. A VISION-model sense: a local vision model's holistic read of the
//      whole thing, escalated on disagreement to a larger model, judged by
//      a mechanical read it cannot outvote for precise detail.
//
// A THIRD SENSE (organs/look-screen.js, added with the screenshot pipeline — native/docs/SCREENSHOT-PIPELINE.md): when the
// image is a UI screenshot (a measured gate, not a guess) its structure is MEASURED from the pixels — flat colour regions
// and Tesseract's text — needing only ffmpeg and tesseract. Its facts join the ones the vision read is judged against, its
// text joins the reading, its `visual-box` lines join the fold. ER7_SCREEN=0 turns it off.
//
// The two never run blind: a judge call checks the vision read against the
// mechanical facts and escalates only on a real, named disagreement
// (settleImageRead, below — the fold's own "multiple eyes, triggered by
// disagreement" discipline, ported to node). What gets landed is a FUSION
// — one plain description the talking model can speak from, plus the
// addressed per-region facts as supporting, citable detail.
//
// "Looking at text" is the same capacity one step back: text whose
// formatting the plain-text reader is reading WRONG (a table, multi-column
// layout, unusual whitespace, an embedded diagram) is rendered to an image
// and looked at — the reader stops guessing at the flat bytes and sees the
// thing the way a person would. `weirdFormattingScore` names when that has
// happened (the trigger), `renderTextToImage` makes the image, and
// `lookAtImage` reads it.
//
// REQUIRES (each refused loudly, never silently degraded, per the
// discipline visual-rec.mjs already established for VISUAL_DETECT_PYTHON):
//   - VISUAL_DETECT_PYTHON → a venv python with opencv-python-headless +
//     numpy (the mechanical box detector), plus a real `tesseract` binary.
//   - a vision model pulled on OLLAMA (default: moondream → qwen2.5vl:7b).
//   - on macOS, QuickLook (`qlmanage`) for the text→image render. Off-macOS
//     text rendering is not built yet — `renderTextToImage` says so rather
//     than guessing.

// This names when the plain-text reading of a page is not the page. Pure,
// declared inputs, testable — no render, no model, no I/O.
//
// Two verdicts are kept apart on purpose (measured: conflating them is how a
// page with an ordinary infobox image would have auto-rendered on every
// fetch):
//   `signals` — the SURVEY: everything that could make a page worth looking
//       at, including pages whose text extracted fine (embedded tables,
//       images, SVG diagrams, iframes). Recorded on the history entry so /look
//       and a reader can see why a page might deserve a look. A signal here is
//       NOT a reason to auto-render.
//   `auto` — CLEAR EXTRACTION AMBIGUITY, and only that: the text dump found
//       nothing at all (a JS shell, an image-only page), or the extracted text
//       itself reads wrong under the same weirdFormattingScore discipline the
//       file reading already applies. Auto-look fires on THIS and nothing
//       else — a page whose prose extracted fine is read fine as text, however
//       many tables or images it carries.
// The third path is the USER ASKING about what is on a page — the /look door
// (always full) and the caller's own look-intent gate beside this trigger.
