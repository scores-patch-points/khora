// Handle: Solon — the Athenian lawgiver. Asked for the best constitution,
// he gave one that binds the rulers to the laws exactly as the laws bind
// the citizens. Here the rulers are the mechanisms that CLAIM to enforce
// the constitution, and Solon's job is to check that every claim is read
// by a test, that the record replays, that the results are enforced, and
// that the failure set stays the same by name — and to re-zero (REC) a
// standing only on evidence. THE REGISTER — the one authoritative list of
// the instrument's watchers; an archon's own header cites it, never
// restates it:
//
//   heimdall   the bridge — every surface, the steering, the admission,

//              it, address residue no writer wrote, and whether the whole
//              fits the window heimdall says the model is loaded at. Names

//              (P186). Under heimdall. (live)
//   elenchus   Socrates — the standing question: every non-AGREE crown
//              carries one closed-bank question (elenchus.js), and no live
//              claim in view refuses the oracle default (gary.js's
//              no-oracle-mode). Keeps the mouth from being an oracle. (live)
//   nagarjuna  the four corners — one lattice for every mechanical verdict
//              (is/is-not/both/neither, hl.js's own Belnap-Dunn FDE), never
//              a second one under a different name; a name reused across
//              files for a different meaning must have each file's own
//              header say so. Checked mechanically against hl.js's real
//              values and involution, never asserted. (live)
//
// Amendment: an archon is added or removed by proposal — ratified by the
// person, checked by the chorus — never by a session alone.
//
// Solon is the one that keeps the instrument's own record
// honest while it runs for months.
//
// A LIBRARY, not a daemon: this organ knows nothing of any one repository.
// The repo it keeps is handed in (`root`, and the constitution's enforcement
// map); the surface that runs a keeper — the-fold's solon-run.mjs — supplies
// them, and its port probe. `createKeeper` / `startServer` / `runLiveSweep`
// are the same machinery whoever wires them.
//
// THE HEARTBEAT — why it is legitimate, not decoration:
//   A dead watcher is the one failure the watcher cannot report itself.
//   Each beat is cheap, monotonic (seq), and appended to the same
//   append-only log; ASHBY reads the FILE, never this process's memory,
//   so a lying or buggy Solon cannot vouch for itself. The heartbeat's
//   absence is the signal: stale beats mean the instrument is running
//   unguarded. It also carries a surface probe — typed, never convicting
//   (a probe that cannot reach its real check reports "unknown", never
//   "down", heimdall's own research rule).
//
// The walls, this project's own law applied to the regulator:
//   - EVA probes before it convicts; every verdict names its evidence.
//   - A standing (the failure set, the unenforced-results count) re-zeros
//     only on evidence — REC, never a silent tune.
//   - II.23 applies to the regulator: Solon's own controls must be able to
//     fail (the planted deviations in solon.test.mjs), and Ashby checks
//     they exist.
//   - The regulator is part of the regulated: Solon's log is on the same
//     append-only record it audits.
