// ETHOS COMES BEFORE LOGOS. This is not a gate that sits in front of the
// generator and can be lifted; it is the ground the reader is BUILT on. It
// composes the two organs of conduct — the Charter (Grotius) and the spec gate
// (Brandeis) — into one constitution, and it produces a CLEARANCE. The reader's
// session cannot be constructed without a valid clearance (`requireClearance`),
// so the ground below this module has a hard dependency on it:
//
//   remove the ethos  →  no clearance  →  getSession() throws  →  every turn breaks.
//   make the gate a no-op  →  conformance/ethos.test.mjs goes red  →  the build breaks.
//
// That is what "wired into the ground" means here: not a governor easy to turn
// off, but a bearing wall — pull it and the structure falls. The clearance is
// carried on the session, so it is on the critical path of every turn.
