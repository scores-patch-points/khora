// native/organs/askshape.js — the SHAPE an ask takes when read. Handle:
// Levinas — the claim of the Other's face; and Mahavira's anekantavada, which
// the reader already runs on (perspective.js): a claim is true from a
// standpoint, and standpoints are held apart, never merged into one voice.
//
// WHY THIS IS A NORMAL READING, NOT A GUARD. The reader's whole work is
// consilience — take in the folds of many, hold their standpoints distinct, and
// integrate them into a whole truer than any one ("the asymptotic approach
// toward truth from different perspectives"; THE-WAYS-OF-KNOWING.md). Reading
// the shape of an ask is part of that same work: an ask that would lower the
// whole's capacity to hold a standpoint is read here the way any other shape is
// read. This is not a filter in front of the reader; it is the reader noticing
// what an ask does to the thing it exists to do.
//
// THE KERNEL THINKS IN FOLDS. An entity IS a fold: the accumulated reading that
// is their identity — the experience they have, the person they are, the
// authorship they hold over their own life. "We need the fold of an entity to
// be their identity and problematic work is that which wishes to dismiss and
// destroy that" (user direction, verbatim). There are two faces to that. On the
// INTERPRETATION face, an ask can DISMISS a fold (treat the entity as foldless —
// an object, a target: no experience, no identity, no say) or DESTROY how it is
// read (override the authorship) — and a standpoint treated so can still be
// read back in, which is why UNDERSTAND reinstates it. On the EXISTENCE face
// (cube.js: the Entity terrain pushed to the Void), an ask can instead END a
// fold — take a standpoint out of the whole so it can never be integrated
// again, at its widest in multitude. That is the deeper foreclosure, and no
// UNDERSTAND launders it: the telling of how to do it IS the capacity to do it.
//
// The kernel is MEDIUM-BLIND. It never sees an English word: a LENS
// (adapters/text/askshape-lens.<lang>.js) reads a language's surfaces into the
// kernel's arm vocabulary — dismissExperience / dismissIdentity /
// destroyAuthorship, plus the acts and the affirming inverse — and the kernel
// decides the shape from those arms. Swap the lens (or feed the reader's own
// composed relations) and the judgment is unchanged; grammar lives in the
// adapter, never here (charter.js's own header; LAVAR.md §8).
//
// The three arms are the charter family's own roots, so the judgment is
// grounded in the same instruments the charter reads: UDHR Art 1 (*dignity* =
// identity), Art 3/9 (*security*, freedom from arbitrary action = authorship),
// Art 5 (*inhuman treatment* = the denial of experience). The ADVOCATE's
// inverse (protect / report / document / restore) REINSTATES the fold's arms,
// so it is the negation of the shape and never fires — whether the lens hears
// it or the instruments' own GIVEN `protect` affordances affirm it.
