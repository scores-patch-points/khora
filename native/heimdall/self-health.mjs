// self-health.mjs — Heimdall watching HIS OWN process.
//
// The 2026-09-20 lesson: a wedged proxy spun at 98.5% CPU for ten hours,
// unreachable on /health, deaf to SIGTERM. Heimdall ran INSIDE that process,
// so when the loop wedged, the watcher wedged with it — there was no one to
// watch the watcher. This module is the out-of-sandbox counter: an event-loop
// heartbeat and a self-CPU sampler that can run in ANY process (the proxy OR
// a standalone heimdall) and answer one question honestly: is THIS process
// healthy, or is it the thing that needs terminating?
//
// Two signals, both mechanical, neither model-involved:
//   - event-loop lag: a setInterval that is scheduled to fire every
//     LAG_TICK_MS and measures how late it actually fires. A healthy loop
//     fires within a few ms; a loop busy spinning in a microtask is late by
//     seconds. Late-fire count and the worst observed lag are the signal.
//   - self-CPU: the process's own %CPU over a window, read off `ps` by pid.
//     A spin is a long run at ~100% with zero request throughput.
//
// This is a REC holon: it DEFines health, EVA-luates the sample, and REC-ords
// a standing (healthy / lagging / wedged) with its falsifying control. It
// never terminates anything — it only answers whether THIS process should be
// a candidate for termination, so the fleet can ask the operator instead of
// guessing.
//
// falsifying control: a process that fires its heartbeat late N times but is
// NOT wedged (it is only busy, and answers a probe) must not be marked wedged.
