// cli/claude-code-recall.mjs — REASONING CARRIES FORWARD, NOT ONLY BACKWARD
// (2026-09-25). claude-code-steer.mjs and claude-code-reason-gate.mjs make
// eoreader7 reasoning a precondition for LEAVING a turn (deny a write, block
// a Stop) — enforcement at the boundary, once. Nothing fed the other
// direction: what an earlier turn in this same session already proved
// through cli/reason.mjs never re-entered a later turn's own context, so
// turn 5 could restate — or quietly contradict — something turn 2 already
// ran through falsifyGfp and left standing. A UserPromptSubmit hook.
//
// Read-only, and reuses rather than reimplements: findMatches/foldMatches
// are cli/claude-code-context.mjs's own fold, exported from that file for
// this import (tests/reasoning-claims-ledger.test.mjs T1-T4 already pin
// that fold correct; this file adds no new folding logic of its own). Seed
// "/" is that file's own documented no-special-case default — every claim
// THIS SESSION declared matches, the same siloed scope its own T3 test
// requires (a different session's claims never leak in). The folded set is
// then filtered by native/organs/claim-relevance.js's relevantClaims
// before the CAP below ever applies — see that file's own header for the
// measured, no-hand-set-threshold design (and its disclosed limits) that
// decides which of them are worth this turn's tokens. Never blocks,
// never writes session state (no saveState call — nothing here can race
// claude-code-ledger.mjs's own writes to the same per-turn state file, the
// lost-update class this repo's own memory documents against this file's
// siblings) — this only ever reads the durable, cross-turn
// documents/eoreader7-reasoning:1.jsonl ledger, a different file from that
// per-turn state entirely. Silent when nothing is folded yet (a session's
// first turn, or one with no reasoned claims) — no padding.
//
// No off-switch by design: ~/.claude/eo-reason/steer.off governs
// ENFORCEMENT (claude-code-state.mjs's own header), and this never denies
// or blocks anything to enforce. Fails open on its own error, logged, same
// as every sibling hook.
