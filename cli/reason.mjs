// means the claim was actually TESTED, not just never contradicted because
// nothing else was in the room (organs/reasoning-lint.js's own header, and
// THE-NULL-STATES.md's meta-null, explain why coherence alone can't tell
// those two apart). R1 inference licences (lintInferences), refutation by
// measured counterexample, equations by mathjs, "a must precede b" by the

// second, opt-in falsification axis on top: edge-case mutation of a strict
// claim's own role values (empty, null, self-referential), tested against

// gating the other:
//
//   THE STRUCTURED CLAIMS (design part A/C — THE ROOT-CAUSE FIX): every
//   declared claim this run made, as-is (ground/rel/roles/said), whenever
//   there is at least one — regardless of whether `text` was given. Before
//   this widening the durable feed fired only `if (text && declared.length)`,
//   so a bare `node cli/reason.mjs spec.json --json` run with claims but no
//   prose to read — T1's own shape — never reached the ledger at all; the
//   claims a caller most wants remembered (short, structured, GFP-checked)
//   were exactly the ones this gate excluded. Read back later, AT READ TIME
//   and SCOPED, by cli/claude-code-context.mjs (design part C/D) — this file
//   only ever appends, never folds across runs.

//   `hl`/`hlLog` exist — both reader:engine and testimony:claude witnesses,
//   neither dropped, folded WITHIN this one run and appended as a separate
//   record of what this run's own reading and declaring agreed on.
//
// This runs regardless of `out.ok` — a failed run's reasoning is still real
// reasoning worth keeping — and it never touches `out` itself (computed
// above already) or throws past this file: a write failure here must never
// change --json/--compact/plain output or the exit code below. See
// cli/reasoning-ledger.mjs for what gets written and where, and
