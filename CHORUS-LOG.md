# Chorus log — append-only, one entry per lint run

## 2026-09-21 — kleeneUp pre-commit chorus (branch `archon-kleeneup`, staged diff)

fast: 14 files · affected tests 39/39 pass (kleene-up 19, verbatim-snip 10, content-rules 5 × 8 runs — the ordering flake fixed) · law: ok (P5.2 cited, verified against POLICIES.md — the self-verification discipline, exactly the ADDRESS-BOUND wall; pre-existing dup-header WARNs P115/P116/P117/P19/P233 and S17/S96, untouched by this diff)

**Tier 1 FAIL is pre-existing base breakage, disclosed:** the committed
`native/organs/index.js` exports from `./apollo.js`, but `apollo.js` /
`apollo-swarm.js` / `apollo.test.mjs` are UNTRACKED files sitting in the main
worktree's dirty working tree — they are not in commit `926462e` (this
branch's base) nor in `main`'s tip `3fade7d`. Every test that imports
`organs/index.js` therefore fails `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on a clean checkout
(measured: 129 failures here, 0 on the main worktree where the dirty tree
carries apollo.js). Per this log's own 2026-09-19 incident — a bare commit
swept another session's pre-staged files into a commit — this diff does NOT
carry apollo.js: it is another session's in-flight work, not this archon's,
and the base will self-heal when that work commits. The FAIL is not this
diff; the affected tests that import ONLY this diff's files all pass.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Simon/Chekhov | — new module no test imports | native/organs/kleene-up.js | fixed | the organ was unwired at first; now imported and verified in native/tests/kleene-up.test.mjs (CELL, REFUSALS, KINDS, auditField) — the physics kernel tested, the organ seam wired |
| Marshall | P5.2 | native/kernel/kleene-up.js:14 (ADDRESS-BOUND wall) | clean | P5.2 in the-fold POLICIES.md is the self-verification discipline (an assertion with no bytes is `unaddressed`) — the wall (address holds the needle or is refused) is that doctrine applied to finding/snipping, not a stretched citation |
| Feynman | III.3 | README.md (sweep counts) | clean | 1786 / 749 / 1008 / 29 are the actual survey's counted fields in kleeneup-report.json — reproducible by `node scripts/kleene-up.mjs`, not a tuned number |
| Diaconis | II.23 | native/tests/kleene-up.test.mjs (falsifying controls) | clean | a pattern-bleed span and a drifted-address refusal are both pinned by real tests — the effect exists and would be caught if it stopped |
| Diaconis | II.23 | content-rules.mjs:80 `sort` (measured flake) | fixed | the store's newest-sharpened-first sort TIED on identical same-millisecond `lastSharpenAt` and fell to unstable insertion order (the ordering test flaked ~40% of runs, zebra beating alpha by luck); added a monotone preservation-order tiebreaker — the later-preserved rule wins a tie, never the sort's mood |
| Frankfurt | III.3 | kleeneup-report.json / kleeneup-migration.md | clean | both are generated artifacts carrying measured counts and real file:line pointers, no placeholders; `runAt` timestamp disclosed |
| Kondo | — stray / dead | scripts/kleene-up.mjs | noted | the CLI is a command a person runs (exempt); the report + migration files are referenced by the README, not stray |

clean: Dijkstra (locale fold is typed en-US and offset-mapped), Greenberg (no language parameter introduced; the tokenizer is disclosed grammar), Alexander (no composition seam added), Holmes (no alias/identity merge), Pearl (no corroboration claim), Ostrom (no credit/scope claim).

## 2026-09-21 — kleeneUp: the regex-eviction archon is born (branch `archon-kleeneup`)

Build (not a lint run): a new worktree, `eoreader7-archon-kleeneup`, branched
from `926462e` (main has since advanced one commit to `3fade7d`; this archon
is based on the older tip, disclosed). The mission: remove regex-based
FINDING and SNIPPING and re-seat it on the physics system — a thing is found
by its byte address in the field, never by a pattern; a snip is cut at a
permanent address, never by a match.

What landed, each verified green in-session:
- `native/kernel/kleene-up.js` (Handle: Kleene) — the physics primitives:
  `findNeedle`/`findNeedles` (needle measurement with folded index + original
  offset map), `windowAt` (the encounter around an anchor), `snipAt` (verbatim
  cut, sha256 ground, drifted address REFUSED — never silently re-found), and
  `reduceRegex` naming each pattern literal / semantic / structural /
  typed_gap. 17/17 tests (`native/tests/kleene-up.test.mjs`), falsifying
  controls carried (pattern matching bleeds across a span; a needle does not;
  a drifted ground is refused).
- `native/organs/kleene-up.js` — the organ seam (SIG·Figure, typed refusals,
  `auditField`), grounded in the physics canon: mechanic `kleene-up` cut from
  the Mozi three tests, sha256-verified by `canon-ground.mjs` (load check:
  ungrounded false, mechanic located).
- `native/organs/verbatim-snip.js` — the worked migration: the word-class
  intent regexes (QUOTE_VERB / EXACTNESS / QUOTE_ME_FRAME / EXACT_TEXT_OF)
  and the QUOTABLE_WORKS `match` regexes replaced by needle measurement over
  the tokenized field (single words — the tokenizer is structural grammar,
  disclosed) and the folded raw field (phrases). The remaining regexes are
  the scaffold parser (structural) and are disclosed as kept. Public API
  unchanged; 10/10 tests green.
- `scripts/kleene-up.mjs` — the standing sweep: surveys the repo, names every
  regex occurrence, writes `kleeneup-report.json`, `--plan` writes the
  migration plan. Current count: **1786** occurrences — **749 migratable**
  (651 literal + 98 semantic), **1008 structural** (kept, disclosed), **29
  typed gaps** (named). It measures; it never blind-rewrites — an archon that
  evicted regex with a regex would be hoist by its own petard. The sweep has
  already consumed two of its own occurrences (the classifier's
  `/i/.test(flags)` literals became `flags.includes("i")`): the archon
  cleans what it preaches.

Disclosed limitations: the survey scanner is line-wise (a regex spanning
lines can be missed, a division sign can be misread as a literal); the
classification is of PATTERNS, so a literal pattern used in `.replace`/
`.split` is an operation the reviewer must judge; the classifier's own
structural tests remain regexes (grammar, not finding). The migration is
per-file work under the organ's own audit; `verbatim-snip.js` is the worked
example, not the whole sweep.

## 2026-09-08 — organs/hyperlexicon.js renamed to notes-text.js, and every collision it caused (branch `rename-notes-text-face`)

fast: 5 staged files (+ ~40 mechanically-edited importers, `git add -A` pending) · 11 affected test files, 178/178 pass · law: ok (citations resolve; two pre-existing dup-header WARNs — P115/P116/P117/P19 in the-fold, S17 here — neither touched by this diff, confirmed identical on `git stash`)

Not a new feature: `native/organs/hyperlexicon.js` (the text face of `kernel/notes.js`) shared its name with the real Xushen affordance ledger, `kernel/hyperlexicon.js` — five eval files had already hand-aliased the collision (`createChemistry`) rather than name it. Renamed the file and every colliding export (`makeHyperlexicon`→`makeNotesText`, member `createHyperlexicon`→`createNotes`, `foldHyperlexicon`→`foldNotes`, `readingFromHyperlexicon`→pass-through `readingFromNotes`); `kernel/hyperlexicon.js` itself untouched. ~40 importers fixed mechanically (import path + the four renamed identifiers, dotted-property-safe so the 5 dual-importers' kernel-side `createHyperlexicon` was never touched); `capacities.js`'s registry row and `organs/index.js`'s re-exports updated to match. Cross-repo: the-fold's 332-byte shim (`hyperlexicon.js`) re-pointed at the new path — required, not optional: `native/eval/the-fold/lib/{door-probe,borodino-ledger}.mjs` and `live_priors/scripts/eot-digest.mjs` all reach the organ through that shim, and `kind-standing.test.mjs` (this repo's own suite) failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` through it before the fix. Two one-line aliased imports (`makeNotesText as makeHyperlexicon`) keep the-fold's `app.js` (~30 local uses of `hyperlexiconFor`) and live_priors' driver byte-identical downstream of the rename.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Feynman | — (no constant/skip introduced) | notes-text-identity.test.mjs:14 | clean | comment restates a real measured finding (0/29 witnessed) with a pre-existing, slightly stale driver-path shorthand — not touched by this diff |
| Dijkstra | — (no locale/hash logic introduced) | notes-text-identity.test.mjs:35 | clean | `toLowerCase`+determiner-strip is self-labeled "A TOY canonicalizer, test-only" in the same comment block — disclosed stub, pre-existing, unmodified by the rename |
| Holmes | P73 (identity seam) | notes-text-identity.test.mjs:1 | clean | file is about identity by design; rename touched names only, not the merge logic |
| Pearl | P73 corroboration mechanism | notes-text-identity.test.mjs:48 | clean | the two witnesses are two distinct sources (`borodino.txt#1-9`, `war-and-peace.txt#2-9`) — no shared-cause conflation |
| Frankfurt | — (test double) | notes-text-identity.test.mjs:84 | clean | comment explicitly discloses it as "A stub lens shaped exactly as makeGrammarLens's return" |
| Alexander | composition seam | notes-text-identity.test.mjs:83 | clean | test genuinely asserts gate-before-identity ordering (a settled non-verb refused, a real verb still admitted through identity) — read in full, not superficial |

clean: Marshall (no law edited or cited beyond the two pre-existing, untouched WARNs), Simon/Chekhov (`notes-text.js` flagged "new" by the git-rename heuristic; false positive — it's the byte-identical prior module, imported by 4 direct test files plus ~40 more transitively, all passing)


## 2026-09-05 — the audit finished: fixture refusal, four lib/test extractions, audit runner (branch `p94-audit-pass13`, S65 / the-fold P95)

Constitution: `../eo-constitution/CONSTITUTION.md` + this repo's READING-SPEC.md / CLAUDE.md and the-fold's POLICIES.md. Reviewed diff: `git diff --cached` on `p94-audit-pass13` (36 files; new `eval/the-fold/lib/{walk-fixtures,mhc-control,full-circuit,door-probe,object-boundary,reasoning-e2e}.mjs`, six new `tests/*.test.js`, `audit-results.sh`, nine driver edits, S65, eleven results-doc stamps). The ten cell personas were launched as parallel subagents and all ten were terminated by the session rate limit before reporting; the ten lenses were then run sequentially in-session per the skill's fallback, Marshall last.

| persona | cell | citation | file:line | verdict | summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Diaconis | NUL | II.23 resolution (a control must be able to fail); III.3 typed gap | lib/mhc-control.mjs:17 | fixed | `keys.length < 2` let `borodino borodino` pass as two materials with a same-content "control"; now `new Set(keys).size < 2`, pinned in mhc-control.test.js |
| Diaconis | NUL | II.23 | lib/object-boundary.mjs `boundedCutGap` `debris === 0` branch | noted, not fixed | material with nothing to cut reads identical arms as honest and cannot tell reachable from unreachable; disclosed in tests/object-boundary.test.js; the Dracula slice always carries debris (730/1590) |
| Feynman | DEF | III.5 "a typed gap no test reads is a report"; IV.4 citation trail | tests/{hyperlexicon-door-probe,reasoning-e2e,object-boundary}.test.js `skip:` | noted, disclosed | the three cross-repo tests skip typed where the-fold is not beside the engine; they run and pass on the `./fold` layout both repos assume, and each header says so; enforcement is real only on that layout |
| Feynman | DEF | IV.4 | results/*-RESULTS.md stamps | clean | every classification in the stamps was checked against the run logs and the tracked-JSON diffs; "reproduces" for pruning-timeline rests on a one-string diff read in full |
| Dijkstra | SEG·Field | III.3 (a wrong number, silently) | audit-results.sh `git diff --quiet -- results/$f` | fixed | measured the working tree against the INDEX; a staged regeneration would read "reproduces"; now `git diff --quiet HEAD --` |
| Dijkstra | SEG·Field | II.5 type error before null | cited-source-null.mjs / ordered-read-reach.mjs module body wrapped in `else { }` | clean | no `export` inside the block, top-level `await` legal, `process.exitCode = 2` set before; both run to exit 2 on this checkout |
| Simon | SEG·Network | S64 (the unmigrated `e.subject` read) | 14 drivers under eval/the-fold still match `e.subject/e.verb/e.object` | deferred-with-reason | several are legitimate fallbacks (`e.end2 ?? e.object`, `edgesOf`, `queryFillers`); each must be read, not counted — NEXT-PASSES Pass 14 item 5 carries the grep and the caveat |
| Simon | SEG·Network | P95 fixture rule | gate-proof.mjs, ranke-walk.mjs, ranke-backwards.mjs | clean | they read faces through `primary-faces/index.json` and already land a typed `not-kept` gap per face; they are fetch/replay drivers, not nulls over a named walk — the rule's scope is the two drivers that pool the walk's faces |
| Frankfurt | INS | III.3; P41 (the instrument's state as a fact) | lib/object-boundary.mjs gap `detail` | fixed | the message asserted the CAUSE (P80, 2214e1a) as if the code had checked it; now states what was verified (identical arms over cuttable material) and dates the recorded cause separately |
| Frankfurt | INS | IV.4 | S65 / stamps: every count | clean | 1,020 / 4 / 6 / 3-3-0, 36/30/18, 16/12/0, 1,590 / 0.459, 373/277/249, 350/338/189, 106/20/86 all read off the run logs and diffs in this session |
| Ostrom | CON | II.9 (a property of the instrument vs the material); P41 | subject-wall / rashomon stamps, S65, P95 | fixed (wording) | drift had been attributed to S63/S64 as cause without isolation; now named as candidates, "not isolated here" |
| Ostrom | CON | III.3 | cited-source-null refusal scope (whole run on one absent face) | upheld | a null's pool is the walk's or it is not comparable; partial pools were the P94 finding; scope is the run by design, stated in the gap |
| Holmes | SIG | P11 identity through the cast; II.23 | lib/object-boundary.mjs `addr()` pairing key | deferred-with-reason | start+label+end1 collides where one sentence yields two edges on one subject and verb — the "moved: 53" artifact on identical arms; the doc's own 782 carried the same key; fix belongs with the referent-aware trim (Pass 14 item 2, now says so) |
| Holmes | SIG | P11 | lib/door-probe.mjs `closed.has(String(n.verb).toLowerCase())` | clean | the hand list is a disclosed measurement instrument, not identity; the new `unattestedLabels` column is the mechanical companion |
| Pearl | EVA | II.22 convergent inference (independent readings) | S65 / reasoning-e2e stamp "identical verdict table" | fixed (wording) | the-fold's hypergraph.js re-exports the engine's — one reader over two adapter providers; corroborates the adapters, not the reader; now says so |
| Pearl | EVA | II.23 | tests/hyperlexicon-door-probe.test.js B == C assertion | clean | B and C differ only by the gate; equality IS the "wall behind a wall" claim and fails the day the gate refuses something |
| Alexander | SYN | III.4 one implementation | drivers vs lib/ | clean | each driver imports its lib; no second copy of the computation remains (full-circuit, door-probe, object-boundary, reasoning-e2e stdout diffed identical before/after the move) |
| Alexander | SYN | — | audit-results.sh map vs tests/ and results/ | clean | every named test exists; every tracked artifact path exists; print-only entries name their gitignored JSON |
| Chekhov | residual | III.5 "prose may not claim wiring" | lib/borodino-ledger.mjs:34 `BOUNDED` flag | deferred-with-reason | points at the `boundedObjects` opt-in the-fold P80 removed; NEXT-PASSES Pass 14 item 2: build the referent-aware trim or remove the flag — not both left standing |
| Chekhov | residual | — | lib/object-boundary.mjs `measureArm`, `redealtBoundary` exports | clean | exported for the test's reach; used by `measureObjectBoundary`; `lcg` in the driver still drives the sample shuffle |
| Marshall | meta | IV.1/IV.2 | POLICIES.md P95, READING-SPEC S65 | upheld — compliant | policy entries, not constitutional amendments; each carries its Generality line (the-fold's generality-gate test passes on P95); enforcement tests ship in the same diff (IV.1's shape) |
| Marshall | meta | citations above | this table | upheld | every citation re-read against the article text; Ostrom's II.9 and Pearl's II.22 apply as stated; no finding struck |

**Fixed this run:** Diaconis ×1, Dijkstra ×1, Frankfurt ×1, Ostrom ×1 (wording), Pearl ×1 (wording). **Deferred with reason, carried in NEXT-PASSES Pass 14:** Simon ×1, Holmes ×1, Chekhov ×1. Suites re-run after the fixes; counts in the commit message.

## 2026-09-05 — S76: the perceivers beyond text crossed under parity; the measuring door over decoded media; frontier-25 (branch `frontier-25`)

Constitution: `../eo-constitution/CONSTITUTION.md` + READING-SPEC.md + the-fold POLICIES.md. Tier 1 (`chorus-fast.sh --working`): law ok (P115, S76 resolve; P19/S17 pre-existing warned), routed Diaconis · Feynman · Dijkstra · Marshall; native suite 655 pass / 0 fail / 1 TODO (pre-existing) · media-perceiver-parity 4/4 · measure-media 5/5 · frontier-25 4/4.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Diaconis | II.23 | organs/measure.js:581 (probe's example declaration) | clean | draws 200 is the repo's standing null-arm number the probe already taught for wav; the decoded media use the same door, same nothing, and the two-shot video's `degenerate_ground` is pinned as the honest verdict (tests/measure-media.test.js) |
| Feynman | III.3 | organs/measure.js:486 `frameFloor` 1 vs 2 | clean | a scanline or a transition is one unit; two samples are the least PCM can be heard in — both are the material's own grain, and the refusal text says which |
| Dijkstra | III.4 one implementation | adapters/{image,video}/material.js | clean | crossed verbatim from the frozen provider, ffmpeg spawn included and disclosed; parity 4/4 on identical decoded frames; no second reduce anywhere (measure.js takes the reduces injected) |
| Marshall | IV.1; P71 | READING-SPEC S76, README pointer, CAPACITY-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN addendum | upheld — compliant | S76 carries its Generality line and its enforcement (parity, measure-media, frontier-25 tests) in the same diff; no capacity row added — the plan's addendum says why (a perceiver is a giver, `measure` is the registered organ) |
clean: nothing struck.

## 2026-09-07 — P166 / S78: the tip is extended in place; transience declared by the chain's owner; a superseded turn's fold reconstructed on demand (branch `fold-memory-p157`)

Constitution: `../eo-constitution/CONSTITUTION.md` + READING-SPEC.md + the-fold POLICIES.md. Lenses run in-session over `git diff` of `native/kernel/fold.js`, `native/kernel/reading.js`, `native/eval/read-cost.mjs`, `native/tests/fold-transient.test.js` (new).

| lens | citation | file:line | verdict | one line |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Diaconis | II.10 | native/tests/fold-transient.test.js (chainView tests) | clean | the hit is asserted as array identity and as a counted compute — a chainView that silently recomputed would fail both; nothing here passes vacuously |
| Feynman | P88 (guard reachability); P159 | native/kernel/fold.js:139–160 header; native/kernel/reading.js:79–80 | **fixed** | the first cut claimed "nothing holds a superseded fold" and extended in place unconditionally; `tests/identity-revision.test.js:20` holds `fold1` and reads it after `fold2` — the claim was false and the suite said so. Transience is now declared by the chain's owner; the public functions stay pure by default |
| Feynman | P159 step 2 (shape AND cost) | POLICIES P166 table | clean | timings are disclosed as contended (the P145 arm ran beside both); the heap column is per-process and is the finding; time is reported as unchanged, not improved |
| Dijkstra | III.4 | native/kernel/fold.js:203–221 `tipOf`, `parent` index copy | clean | ownership is coupled to `STREAM.has && !isFrozen`; a pure copy of an owned tip COPIES the parent's index instead of stealing it, so a what-if branch off the reader's live fold cannot cost the reader a rebuild |
| Simon | P95 (a driver refuses what it lacks) | native/kernel/fold.js `upsertById`/`removeById` | clean | siblings left copy-on-write on purpose and named in S78: `deriveRelease` reads obligations before and after in one step |
| Frankfurt | II.11; P159 step 0 | native/eval/read-cost.mjs:49 | **fixed** | the header's `logHash 45bbbbbd578d027f` had been stale since P165 put the merge record into the log — a recorded number that no longer corresponded to anything; re-verified from a clean worktree of HEAD and corrected with provenance |
| Ostrom | P161 | POLICIES P166 | clean | "time unchanged" is scoped to 3,051 sentences under load; not generalised to "the copy never costs time" |
| Holmes | P1 (identity is retrieval-time) | native/kernel/reading.js:93 accessor | clean | a turn's `fold` is two things and says which: the tip by identity while it is the tip, a reconstruction once superseded — never the tip's arrays wearing an earlier turn's name |
| Pearl | II.10 | gates + suite | clean, with a caveat recorded | `--identity`, `--trace --against` (240 KB, 480 KB) share one instrument — per-step hashes of the TIP — and could not have seen a stale EARLIER fold; the suite (`identity-revision`) is the independent witness and it is what caught the defect. Both are required |
| Alexander | P159 | reading.js accessor ⇄ `reconstruct` transient ⇄ pure default | clean | the parts compose: the accessor's reconstruction owns its own arrays (asserted), the seed's arrays are never mutated (asserted) |
| Chekhov | — | native/kernel/fold.js:143 `isOwned` | clean | exported for the test that pins the invariant, and used there; the old backward `d.removed` path is gone with the chain it walked |
| Marshall | II.10, II.11, IV.1; P71 | POLICIES P166, READING-SPEC S78, CLAUDE.md pointer | upheld — compliant | P166 carries its Generality line and names its enforcement (fold-transient tests, the two gates); no new constant; P157–P165 had never been written into POLICIES.md and are now, from their commit bodies, each with a Generality line (the gate passes 4/4). One defect about the RUN, not the diff, recorded so it is not repeated: the control's progress was read as `wc -l` of turns.jsonl (744) and reported as "744/1000 turns"; the records reach turn 1000 — read the record's own turn, never the file's line count |
fixed: 2 (Feynman: transience declared; Frankfurt: stale header hash). struck: none.

## 2026-09-07 — the discourse projection's time term (branch `fold-memory-p157`, first of the time-term commits)

Constitution: `../eo-constitution/CONSTITUTION.md` + READING-SPEC.md + the-fold POLICIES.md. Lenses in-session over `native/adapters/text/discourse-referents.js`, `native/tests/discourse-incremental.test.js` (new).

| lens | citation | file:line | verdict | one line |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Diaconis | II.10 | tests/discourse-incremental.test.js | clean | the compute is COUNTED (`discourseStats.computes`): sixty sentences with extras, zero further computes; a spread would fail it at once |
| Feynman | P157 header claim | discourse-referents.js (old header: "twice in a novel") | **fixed** | measured on 60 KB: the slow branch fired on 392 of 926 sentences (42%), not twice — the claim was never measured on this material and the profile (×12.5 growth of the from-scratch lambda) contradicted it |
| Dijkstra | III.4 | `DiscourseState` layer | clean | one implementation serves persistent and layered use; the layer's `gone`/`multi`/`unmulti` sets make deletion and threshold crossing representable without touching the base |
| Holmes | P11 | `projectState` root order | clean | components ordered by their first member's arrival index, groups merged by index — the original's own order, pinned equal to the reference path byte-for-byte |
| Pearl | II.10 | gates | clean | 60 KB identity unchanged; 240 KB (123 steps) and 480 KB (120) byte-identical; the reference-path equality test is a second, independent oracle on synthetic appositions |
| Chekhov | — | old `unionFind` factory | **fixed** | dead since the incremental state landed (its only reference was its own definition); removed |
| Marshall | II.10; P159 | the versioned memo | upheld | the old memo keyed on a state object that `foldStep` mutates in place — stale by construction, harmless only because revision.js ignores known ids; now versioned by (count, seq), pinned by a test that folds a delta and asks again |
fixed: 2. struck: none.

## 2026-09-07 — two more time terms: every known surface in one pass; the hypothesis list maintained (branch `fold-memory-p157`)

Constitution: `../eo-constitution/CONSTITUTION.md` + READING-SPEC.md + the-fold POLICIES.md. Lenses in-session over `native/adapters/text/recursive.js`, `native/adapters/text/individuation.js`, `native/tests/surface-index.test.js`, `native/tests/individuation-incremental.test.js` (new).

| lens | citation | file:line | verdict | one line |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Diaconis | II.10 | tests/surface-index.test.js | clean | the oracle is the single-surface organ itself over 600 real sentences × 27 surfaces, and the test refuses to pass on misses alone (hits > 100 asserted) |
| Feynman | P157 memo claim | individuation.js (old `HYPOTHESIS` memo) | **fixed** | "an untouched group is the same array, so it hits" was true of the overlay and false of the chain path, where `push` grows the array in place — a stale memo, harmless only because the consumer ignores known ids; versioned by length now, pinned by a test that grows a group by a delta |
| Dijkstra | III.4 one implementation | recursive.js `surfaceIndex`/`surfacesIn` | clean | one boundary rule, `containsSurface`'s, reached two ways: word-start `startsWith` for needles that begin with a letter or digit, the regex path per needle for the rest; nested surfaces both report (no alternation) |
| Simon | P95 | `taskTargetOccurrences` | clean, named | still asks `containsSurface` per task target — a handful per sentence, left as is |
| Holmes | P11 | `referentsInSpan`, `witnessRelatedPairs` | clean | hits sorted by the map's own insertion order, so grouping-by-first-hit and the first-three cut reproduce the original exactly; the gates confirm on 480 KB |
| Ostrom | P161 | this entry's numbers | clean | 240 KB profile 15.7 s → 5.2 s under the same arm load; not generalised beyond that material and size |
| Pearl | II.10 | gates + tests | clean | 60 KB identity unchanged; 240 KB (123) and 480 KB (120) byte-identical; incremental == fresh-compute pinned at every one of 40 steps with and without extras |
| Chekhov | — | `descriptorHypotheses` (fold-only) | clean | returns the state's frozen list, the same array while nothing changed (asserted) |
| Marshall | II.10, II.11 | both files | upheld | no new constant; no timing asserted anywhere — structure only (identity, equality, counted hits); the `place()` re-index that showed at 7% self was replaced by a binary search before this landed |
fixed: 1. struck: none.

## 2026-09-07 — the 480 KB cliff, part 1: no-op updates, updates handled in place by the views, same-object re-index skipped, the relation matcher built per vocabulary (branch `fold-memory-p157`)

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Diaconis | II.10 | tests/fold-transient.test.js (no-op), tests/discourse-incremental.test.js (update) | clean | both directions asserted: a same-object re-upsert leaves the array and every view untouched; a value differing in one field IS an update and the view recomputes for it |
| Feynman | P159 step 2 | this entry's own numbers | **disclosed** | the update census I ran counts ids seen twice in the LOG, so it could not show the no-op skip's effect (the log is unchanged by design); the 480 KB profile after the batch moved 79.2 → 77.1 s, within run-to-run contention (perceive rose 26.6 → 33.5 s on unchanged code between two runs). The batch is landed for what it verifiably does — the from-scratch lambdas fell (discourse 4.6 → 0 s, `reviseTextFold` 37 → 27 s) — not for a headline |
| Dijkstra | III.4 | discourse-referents.js `replaceOcc`; individuation.js foldStep | clean | each view names exactly what it reads off an occurrence (id, surface, canonicalSurface; and for individuation edge/relation/role via a forced recompute of that one group) and recomputes on anything else — the update handling is scoped to the fields the state depends on |
| Simon | P95 | hypergraph.js:113 | clean | the skip is on object identity only (`byId.get(id) === entry`); a new object with equal keys still re-indexes — no structural-equality shortcut was invented |
| Holmes | P11 | relations.js `matcherFor` | clean | same source, same flags, same regex; `lastIndex` rewound before every use so the `exec` loop at :872 starts where it always did |
| Pearl | II.10 | gates | clean | 60 KB identity unchanged; 240 KB (123) and 480 KB (120) byte-identical after each of the four changes |
| Chekhov | — | `MATCHERS` bound at 32 | clean, named | a bound of 32 compiled matchers is a budget (memory), not a judgment about material; it is cleared, never evicted by rule |
| Marshall | II.11 | relations.js:212 `32` | upheld | the one new number is a cache bound, commented as such; earned-constants scans exported constants and this is not one, but it is named here so it is not mistaken for a threshold |
fixed: 4 (the four changes). struck: none.

## 2026-09-07 — the 480 KB cliff, part 2: identity revision's edges indexed; the hypothesis view answers "what changed"; anchoring's cast built once per array; live alternatives indexed by first token; the index's entries array made lazy (branch `fold-memory-p157`)

Constitution: `../eo-constitution/CONSTITUTION.md` + READING-SPEC.md + the-fold POLICIES.md. Lenses in-session over `kernel/identity.js`, `kernel/hypergraph.js`, `adapters/text/individuation.js`, `adapters/text/revision.js`, `adapters/text/anchoring.js`, `adapters/text/identity-evidence.js` and their tests.

| lens | citation | file:line | verdict | one line |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Feynman | II.10; P159 step 0 | individuation.js `changedOnly` (first cut) | **fixed, by the gate** | the first cut offered only the extras' surfaces on the argument "an append arrives only as an extra"; the 60 KB log hash moved (`bcf5…` → `f784…`) while every node hash held, and a bisect (individuation reverted, identity index kept) put it on this change. Occurrences also enter the fold through the observation's own entries. `pending` — surfaces any delta touched since the last ask — closes the route; the hash is back; a test pins the exact case |
| Diaconis | II.10 | tests/identity-index.test.js | clean | the reference is the scan the index replaces, reimplemented in the test from `canonicalizeHyperedge` and a `find`; equality at every one of 48 steps through supports, canonicals and attacks; a fixture that produces no CON op (a pair attacked earlier) asserts no REC ops rather than skipping silently |
| Diaconis | II.10 | tests/individuation-incremental.test.js (admission equality) | clean | admissions under `changedOnly` equal admissions from the full list at 60 steps, order included, from a SEEDED fold whose groups were never offered |
| Dijkstra | III.4 | identity.js `edgeIndex` | clean | `touchedEdges` uses the same `participantValue` `touches` used; positions kept so operations come out in fold order; an updated edge with unchanged values is swapped in place, any other update recomputes |
| Holmes | P11 | anchoring.js `normToReferent` | clean | the case-blind fallback kept the FIRST surface whose norm matched (the `break`); Map insertion order reproduces it exactly |
| Simon | P95 | identity-evidence.js `alternativesIndex` | clean | keyed on the alternatives array the kernel already keeps copy-on-write; a new array with equal content rebuilds and answers identically (asserted) |
| Chekhov | — | hypergraph.js `graph.entries` | **fixed** | materialised on every index call — three per sentence — for an array no file in either tree reads (the only `.entries` readers are task-log entries); lazy and cached per graph now. My first cut cached it in a module variable shared by every graph; corrected to a WeakMap before any test ran against it |
| Pearl | II.10 | gates | clean | 60 KB identity unchanged after the fix; 240 KB (123) and 480 KB (120) byte-identical on all five changes together |
| Marshall | II.11 | all six files | upheld | no new constant; the one memo bound (`MATCHERS`, part 1) is a budget and is named there |
fixed: 2 (the changedOnly hole, the shared cache). struck: none.

## 2026-09-07 — the 480 KB cliff, part 3: the identity index handed the fold's own array; the refresh's per-pair normalisation memoised; appended-before-updated in every fold step (branch `fold-memory-p157`)

Constitution: `../eo-constitution/CONSTITUTION.md` + READING-SPEC.md + the-fold POLICIES.md. Lenses in-session over `kernel/identity.js`, `adapters/text/revision.js`, `adapters/text/surfaces.js`, `adapters/text/discourse-referents.js`, `adapters/text/individuation.js` and their tests.

| lens | citation | file:line | verdict | one line |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Diaconis | II.10 | tests/identity-index.test.js | clean | the edge index's from-scratch builds are COUNTED (`identityStats.computes`): 170 in 1,707 sentences before, 1 after; the reference is the concatenation scan, met at every one of 30 steps with extras |
| Feynman | II.10; P159 step 0 | kernel/identity.js edgeIndex foldStep | **fixed, by the gate** | the 480 KB differential diverged at step 5550 while 240 KB held; a bisect cleared the surfaces memo; a per-step delta comparison of two worktrees found step 5534, where the fold's canonical for eleven edges lacked "anatole" and the index's had it. Cause: one delta appends an edge's canonical (a support's REC) and updates it (an attack's REC) in the same call, and my step applied `updated` before `appended`, leaving the index on the stale first. Appended first, then updated, in all three fold steps; a test builds exactly that delta; 480 KB identical again |
| Dijkstra | III.4 | revision.js → deriveIdentityRevision({ fold, extraEntries }) | clean | P157's shape in a third place — a fresh spread of the fold's array — replaced by the fold's own array plus this sentence's entries scanned after it in their own order; `touchesIdentity` is the index's `valuesOf`, the scan's `participantValue` |
| Holmes | P11 | surfaces.js normOf/individuating memos | clean | memoised for the life of one `discoverReferents` call only, since `generic` is decided per call; no caller mutates a returned array (checked: `.length`, `.find`, `.includes`, `.every`) |
| Simon | P95 | discourse-referents.js, individuation.js fold steps | clean | the same reorder applied to the two views where it had only cost a recompute, not correctness — the same seam, fixed in every sibling at once |
| Pearl | II.10 | gates | clean | 60 KB identity unchanged; 240 KB (123) and 480 KB (120) byte-identical after the reorder; the bisect and the two-worktree delta comparison are recorded above as the method that found it |
| Marshall | II.10, II.11 | all five files | upheld | no new constant; the first cut of part 3 was landed nowhere — the gate ran before the commit, which is the order the constitution asks for |
fixed: 1 (the fold-step order). struck: none.

## 2026-09-07 — P168 / S80: an address is given at birth and kept (branch `fold-memory-p157`)

Constitution: `../eo-constitution/CONSTITUTION.md` + READING-SPEC.md + the-fold POLICIES.md. Lenses in-session over `adapters/text/surfaces.js`, `adapters/text/recursive.js`, `tests/addresses-birth.test.js`, `tests/referent-merge.test.js`, `native/eval/read-cost.mjs` (header).

| lens | citation | file:line | verdict | one line |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Diaconis | II.10 | tests/addresses-birth.test.js (partition) | clean | the invariant is asserted refresh by refresh on 120 KB of real material, and the test refuses to pass unless a rename actually occurred — the vacuous pass is closed by construction |
| Holmes | P11; SEED "identity by consequence" | surfaces.js `prior` block | clean | identity is unchanged (the same clusters); only the ADDRESS is stabilised — the earliest-born being keeps its id, a split follows the majority of bearers, a merge is witnessed by the uniting surface |
| Feynman | P159 step 0 | read-cost.mjs header | clean, disclosed | the hashes moved because the reading changed on purpose; the old values stand beside the new with the reason (33 nodes for 38, the same 166 links) |
| Ostrom | P161 | P168's table | clean | cast recall is stated as unable to move under a rename (same partition); the claims are fragmentation, oscillation and record count, measured on one read of one book |
| Simon | P95 | recursive.js reassignment loop | clean | a merge of two prior beings is one record (`merges`, own basis), not a second set of reassignment records for its bearers |
| Chekhov | — | `addresses: "founder"` | clean, named | kept as an opt-in so P165's oscillation stays reproducible in `referent-merge.test.js`; not dead, a control |
| Marshall | IV.1; P71 | P168, S80, the retired test | upheld | the P165 test's own text asked to be retired "with that finding recorded" when the clustering was stabilised; it now pins the finding under the old rule and its absence under the default, in the same diff as the change |
fixed: none needed. struck: none.

## 2026-09-07 — the holograph rebuild: three resolutions, compression, the mouth's door, activation retrieval (d053068, 59c887e, 6fe45fa, a965747, 469d09b)

chorus-fast on each: the only FAIL across the five runs was `matrix-client.test.mjs`'s load-flaky pool test (standing entry; passes 21/21 alone, verified 2026-09-07). One real gate catch: the contract test on d053068 (app.js imports the kernel's activation.js) — fixed in 59c887e, not by the marker.

| persona | article | file:line | verdict | summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Frankfurt | P55 / the 2026-08-18 address decision | firewall.js `mouthFacing`; holon.js around `call` | fixed | the blocks, expectation facts, re-ask facts, P122's snip block and P125's premise facts all put addresses in the model's view; one wall at the mouth's door strikes them all; the record keeps every address |
| Dijkstra | P88 | conversation.mjs `--chunking`; holograph-reading.mjs | fixed | the eval read chapter-sized chunks (328) where the page reads paragraphs (3,743); measured a configuration the page does not run |
| Diaconis | II.11 / P9 | activation-retrieval.js `SENTENCE_CEILING`; resolutions.js `DEPTHS`, `RECURRENCE_FLOOR` | accounted | a declared reader budget per hop, a structural ladder, binding's floor — each stated in place; the cut inside is measured by dmdWindow |
| Holmes | P11 | activation-retrieval.js, resolutions.js, dialogue.js `candidatesIn` | fixed | every retrieval and every block resolves through the index; the candidate scan offers sub-runs so "Later Razumihin" no longer hides a referent |
| Ostrom | P41 | resolutions.js `prominence`; `errorOf` authorship null | fixed | a one-off surface ("God Which") no longer names a ground; no expectation → authorship withheld, never 0 |
| Simon | P97 | activation-retrieval.test.mjs (through the real turn) | measured | reach by referent alone cut the second act about Porfiry — found by the turn-level test, fixed at the grain |
| Marshall | IV.4 | THE-HOLOGRAPH.md; preregistered-lens-arm.md | upheld | predictions written before the arms; the additive control's null result recorded before the compressed arm ran; the void line in fact-block.js (P55's pin) left standing, flagged |

deferred-with-reason: the P55 void line carries negative knowledge in the prompt (user's own rule) but is a measured pin — the user's call. false-positive-on-review: none.

## 2026-09-07 — Merge `fold-memory-p157` (53 commits: S77 long-stream, the kernel memory work, the holograph evals) into main (branch `fold-memory-p157` → main, scope origin/main..HEAD)

fast: 102 files · 53 affected test files, 526 pass, 0 real fail (the one ✖ is the script handing `tests/earned-constants.json` to `node --test`; false-positive-on-review) · full native `npm test` on the merged tree 711 tests, 690 pass, 0 fail, 1 TODO · law: WARN pre-existing duplicate S17 (and the-fold's P19 P115–P117); WARN cited-not-written P0 P171 P580 P582 (pre-existing on the branch).
| Alexander | II.10 | native/eval/the-fold/long-stream.mjs, lib/long-stream.mjs | fixed | two conflicts with main's S77 follow-ups (a083898): the branch's side is the superset (top-level `placeCoverage` import and P145 `expectFor`; `scored()` verdicts), main's inline import and bare verdicts dropped; `tests/long-stream.test.js` 8/8, `frontier-25.test.js` 4/4 with `../the-fold` at its paired merge |
| Simon/Chekhov | — | eval scripts no test imports (read-run, holograph-reading, conversation, read-cost, frankenstein) | noted | evals, reviewed at their commits |
clean: Diaconis, Feynman, Dijkstra, Holmes, Pearl, Ostrom, Frankfurt, Marshall — the merge itself edits no law.
## 2026-09-07 — the driver reads constitutionally and persists the reading; the run figures live in a lib a test reads; THE-HOLOGRAPH §7 is the reading policies (staged: conversation.mjs, lib/conversation-compare.mjs, tests/conversation-compare.test.js, docs/THE-HOLOGRAPH.md, .gitignore)
- chorus-fast: PASS — 3/3 in the one affected test file; citations resolve except `P0`, which is the legacy engine's READING-POLICY.md P0 (the constitutional-reader baseline the doc names by its own register), not a the-fold policy — a cross-repo cite, kept.
- Diaconis (conversation.mjs:189, the resumed reader seeded from `reconstruct`): the perceiver's refresh state restarts on resume — disclosed in the code, not hidden; a fresh read and a resumed read are not byte-identical and the doc does not claim they are.
- Holmes / Pearl / Ostrom / Alexander (THE-HOLOGRAPH.md §7): prose citing S17, S42/S43, S70/S71, S1/S25 as they read; no mechanism changed in this repo for identity, corroboration or scope.
- Simon/Chekhov: `conversation.mjs` is an eval driver, imported by no test by design (P19/P27's posture); `lib/conversation-compare.mjs` is read by `tests/conversation-compare.test.js` (S64/S65) — the first cut read `sections[].relations.claims` off a number and threw on the first real run; reshaped to the driver's own row fields (P96).

## 2026-09-07 — S81 written; holograph-compression.mjs; THE-HOLOGRAPH §6/§7 amended (staged: READING-SPEC.md, eval/the-fold/holograph-compression.mjs, docs/THE-HOLOGRAPH.md)
- chorus-fast: PASS — Generality present on S81; the driver refuses (`fixture_absent`, exit 2) when the reading, the ledger or the run it stands on are absent (S65); it is an eval driver imported by no test by design, and its by-construction rules are pinned in the-fold's resolutions/activation suites.

## 2026-09-07 — merge of origin/main into fold-memory-p157 (worktree `fold-memory-p157-merge`)
- origin/main since the base: a083898 (S77 follow-ups) — its content already stood on this branch; the only conflicts were the two long-stream files (this branch's frame-carrying verdicts and P145's belief kept; main's inner re-import of `placeCoverage`, a duplicate binding, dropped) and this log (both sides kept).
- Suites in the worktree with the frozen submodule initialised and the vendored packages linked: conformance + tests 694 pass / 0 fail (20 skipped or todo); organs 450 of 452 — the two are environment (`aliases.test.mjs`, which another session is fixing uncommitted in the main tree, where organs pass 462/462; and hl-acquire's adversarial case reading the gitignored local POS prior inside the submodule).

## 2026-09-08 — Compliance pass: reassignment separated from merge, resume actually restores the reader, the void row field, the compression driver's transcript, aliases.test.mjs's path (staged: adapters/text/recursive.js, kernel/reading.js, kernel/hypergraph-projection.js, eval/the-fold/conversation.mjs, eval/the-fold/holograph-compression.mjs, eval/the-fold/lib/conversation-compare.mjs, docs/THE-HOLOGRAPH.md, READING-SPEC.md, organs/aliases.test.mjs, tests/{addresses-birth,conversation-compare,referent-merge,resume-state}.test.js)

Constitution: `../eo-constitution/CONSTITUTION.md` + READING-SPEC.md + the-fold POLICIES.md. Tier 1: law ok; suites: conformance+tests 714, 713 pass, 0 fail, 1 TODO (BECOMING, standing); organs 462/462 (aliases included and passing for the first time on a bare checkout).

A compliance review (2026-09-07, this session) found ten defects across the P162–P171/S78–S81 kernel and holograph work. This commit closes the ones that are eoreader7's to fix.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Holmes | II.7; S17; S80 | adapters/text/recursive.js reassignment loop; kernel/hypergraph-projection.js `reassignments` | fixed | `EOReferentMerge@1` carried two different events — a witnessed identity decision and a bare refresh-to-refresh address change — and the-fold's projection unioned both. On the persisted Crime and Punishment reading, 9 of 14 records folded a still-live id and two surviving unions collapsed distinct people. New schema `EOReferentReassignment@1`; only `EOReferentMerge@1` unions on the the-fold side now. `tests/referent-merge.test.js` rewritten: reassignment keeps both live addresses, a true merge still unions, each reassignment emitted once |
| Frankfurt | S25; THE-HOLOGRAPH §7 | kernel/reading.js `restore`; adapters/text/recursive.js `perceiver.restore` | fixed | §7 claimed a resumed read is byte-identical to a straight one; measured false — the perceiver's causal accumulators are not fold entries and do not survive a bare `reconstruct(log)` seed. `restore()` replays the persisted `Encounter@1` rows through `perceive()` to rebuild them; `tests/resume-state.test.js` (new) asserts straight === split-then-resumed, byte-identical |
| Simon | P95/P96 | eval/the-fold/conversation.mjs row; lib/conversation-compare.mjs | fixed | the row never carried `voidsDeclared` (the turn's own field), so `voids` read 0 on every run while the same rows showed typed absences; row now carries it, the compare lib also accepts the legacy `voids` field for older rows |
| Ostrom | P88; S65 | eval/the-fold/holograph-compression.mjs | fixed | the driver called `activate`/`lensBlock`/`activeReferents` with `transcript: []` on every question — a condition the live turn never runs under, since a follow-up naming no referent of its own is meant to bind to the last answer's. Fixed to thread the run's own transcript row by row; questions activating moved 13/25 → 20/25, Lens-at-ceiling 9/13 → 13/20, and level 1's own ceiling (never disclosed before) is now shown — 20 of 20. `results/holograph-compression-RESULTS.md` keeps both, dated; THE-HOLOGRAPH §6 and READING-SPEC S81 amended with a correction note, old figures kept beside new |
| Simon | P95 (a driver refuses what it lacks, never throws on one machine's path) | organs/aliases.test.mjs:10 | fixed | hard-coded `/home/user/live_priors/...`; replaced with a module-relative sibling path and a typed `fixture_absent` refusal — this suite now passes on a bare checkout (462/462 organs, up from 451 excluding this file) |
| Marshall | IV.1; P71 | this entry; THE-HOLOGRAPH.md, READING-SPEC.md correction notes | upheld — compliant | both docs keep the superseded figures beside the corrected ones with a dated note, per this repo's own S64/S65 rule that a committed number is enforcement only when a test reads its computation, and a correction is an addition, never a silent rewrite |

deferred-with-reason: `individuation.js::place()` throws on a lost hypothesis under an update that changes an occurrence's own encounter id — judged unreachable in current callers, disclosed rather than hardened this pass.

false-positive-on-review: none.

## 2026-09-12 — Marshall reconciliation: agent laws (LaVar, Wilson, Kelsen, Ranke) linked to the constitution (working, 3 repos)

fast: 3 files (LAVAR.md, native/READING-SPEC.md, native/organs/reasoning-lint.js) · 57/57 affected tests pass · law: ok (S110 written and resolving; pre-existing dup-header WARNs P115/P116/P117/P19 in the-fold and S17/S96 here; S0 cite WARN is from unreviewed concurrent swarm work already in the working tree, not this diff)

LaVar's charter, Wilson's swarm laws, and the Kelsen seed now carry eo-constitution article citations (IV.4) with their IV.1/IV.2 status disclosed: agent policy under the constitution, proposed not self-enacted, amends no constitution text. S110 — reserved in the sequence since 2026-09-09 but never written — was written from the LAVAR record in the house format with a Generality line. The two divergent LAVAR.md copies (eoreader7, live_priors) were reconciled to one union; live_priors/LAVAR.md is now byte-identical to eoreader7/LAVAR.md. Ranke's P84/P182 received their constitution citations in the-fold.

| Marshall | IV.4; IV.1/IV.2; II.6/II.2/II.9/II.23/III.2/III.3 | LAVAR.md:7, LAVAR.md:303; reasoning-lint.js:10-15; READING-SPEC.md S110 | fixed | every agent law now cites the articles that produce it; status disclosed as proposed-not-self-enacted; the one dangling citation (S110) written, not waived |
| Diaconis | II.23 | LAVAR.md constitution line | clean | the II.23 citation restates the article's control-built-to-fail requirement; no number introduced |
| Pearl | II.22 (etak) | the-fold POLICIES.md P182 | fixed | independence is argued, never assumed — the mandate's corroboration line now cites II.22, whose text matches (a mirror under another host is one channel) |

clean: Feynman/Dijkstra/Holmes/Ostrom/Simon-Chekhov lens hits were all routed by unreviewed concurrent swarm working-tree files (native/eval/lavar/read-real.mjs, the results JSONL), not by this diff; none of this diff's lines introduced a constant, skip, identity, corroboration, or unwired module.
## 2026-09-13 — the surface page cannot boot in a browser: node-only organs in the browser seam, closed (working, uncommitted: native/organs/index.js, native/adapters/text/{recursive,anchoring,discourse-referents,individuation}.js, + new native/adapters/text/sha256hex.js)

Constitution: `../eo-constitution/CONSTITUTION.md` + this repo's READING-SPEC.md/CLAUDE.md. Reviewed diff: driving the real page (the-fold serve.mjs :8811 in headless Chrome) surfaced a SHIPPING blocker — the page never booted: net::ERR_FAILED on `node:child_process`/`node:fs`/`node:crypto` etc., because (a) organs/look.js (Node-only: spawn/fs/os + process.env at load) was statically re-exported by the browser-facing seam index, and (b) the causal perceiver chain (adapters/text/recursive etc.) imported node:crypto for a synchronous sha256hex helper. Fixes, both on the split law: look.js removed from the seam index (server-side consumers import it directly); a new shared synchronous pure-JS sha256hex.js replaces node:crypto in the four adapters, byte-identical output verified against node:crypto on 10 cases incl. Hebrew/Cyrillic/CJK (so content-addressed keys are unchanged — P168). Page boots after: model connects, zero node-builtin errors. Zero new regressions: the-fold 2261/2261/0; the 6 failing native/tests are pre-existing (verified by stashing this diff's tracked files — same 6 without them; they are the engine-internal foldNotes rename drift + a spans front-matter sweep, untouched here).

| persona | cell | citation | file:line | verdict | summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Feynman | EVA | native/adapters/text/sha256hex.js | fixed | a real FIPS-180-4 SHA-256, verified against node:crypto on 10 inputs (empty, multi-byte, CJK, 1000-char) — not a placeholder or a tuned constant |
| Dijkstra | NUL | native/adapters/text/sha256hex.js + callers | clean | the shared sync hash is the base unit both node and the browser resolve identically; content-addressed ids (recursive:132/233/273/439, anchoring:287/386, discourse-referents:24/45, individuation:57) are unchanged because the algorithm is the algorithm — verified, not assumed |
| Holmes | SIG | native/adapters/text/sha256hex.js | clean | one organ, not two — every caller now imports the same sha256hex; node:crypto and the pure-JS fallback were never two entities, the imports were two spellings of one hash |
| Alexander | CON | native/organs/index.js (look removed) | clean | no composition gate silently defaults to "don't compose": look.js's server consumers (look.test.mjs, chapter-swarm.mjs) import it directly, and the seam comment states why it is absent |
| Frankfurt | INS | native/organs/index.js | clean | nothing generated; the removal deletes an export nothing consumed through the index |
| Marshall | meta | the-fold CLAUDE.md "self plane"; this diff | clean | no law edited by this diff; the split (pure organs in the seam, I/O at the caller) is READING-SPEC's own standing rule, cited in the seam comment |

clean: Simon/Chekhov/Ostrom/Pearl — the new module (sha256hex.js) is imported by all four adapters which are imported by tests; no credit/blame or independence claim touched.

## 2026-09-16 — grow the organs for "what is this?" on a giant code hunk: code-grain encounters + the Cuvier what-organ (eoreader7, working; S128)
fast: 8 files · 27 new tests pass (code-hunk, code-scan, proxy-notes, what-organ) · law: ok — S128 added with Generality, citations resolve (P13 S39 S128); the 7 failing affected tests are pre-existing (root-package CJS/ESM: text.js/kernel.js, and the WIP recursive.js) — none imports this diff's files (verified individually)

| Dijkstra | NUL | adapters/code/scan.js (VENDOR_WORD/FINGERPRINTS/ASSET_NAME) | clean | allowlists are received package names, disclosed as received knowledge per row; identity by exact names word-bounded, never casing/hash (bareName strips path prefixes for the boundary test only) |

clean: (single lens routed)

Context: found via a live 24-real-run workflow earlier this session — satisfied:true shipped in 24/24 runs regardless of grounding (race.winner='model' + claims.length=0 still read as checked), and a held-turn cache key collision (heldKey omitted attachments/workspace) served stale cross-topic answers on sequential reuse of one session. Both root-caused and fixed by a follow-up workflow, empirically verified on an isolated test instance (port 11499) without touching the shared live proxy (port 11436). See workflow run wf_3c06eb11-d44 for full investigation/verification detail.

clean: (single lens routed)

Context: POST /api/chat's non-streaming branch was fixed 2026-09-23 to thread void/satisfaction/disclosed into resp.reading through groundingGate. The streaming branch was untouched by that fix and was a bigger gap than it looked: `await turnScope.run(...)` discarded runProxyTurn's return value entirely, so the final done:true NDJSON chunk carried no `reading` key at all -- not just missing void/satisfaction, the whole envelope (sessionId, relationEdges, referentBindings, race, document, etc.), unlike the OpenAI-shaped SSE streaming path (~line 1769) and the swarm-routed streaming case (~line 1946) which already attach one. Fixed by capturing `result`, computing `race` via precisionWinner and gating via groundingGate the same way the non-streaming ollama path (~line 2066) does, then attaching `reading: {...}` to the final chunk. Verified live on an isolated proxy instance (port 11499/11498, PID 57496) against a real gemma2:2b call with stream:true -- final NDJSON line confirmed to carry reading.void.satisfied:false, reading.satisfaction.ok:false, reading.disclosed.unchecked:true (groundingGate correctly firing: race.winner="model", claims.length=0) -- without touching the shared live proxy (PID 58328, port 11436).

**The two test failures are pre-existing, not introduced by this diff** — verified by adding a second, disconnected worktree at the unmodified base commit (`b90a546`) and running both failing files there directly: `tests/perturbation-challenger.test.js` fails identically (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, `kernel/perturbation-challenger.js` does not exist at this commit — the module is only present in the live, uncommitted main checkout, from unrelated concurrent work) and the live-specimen test shares the same root cause.

**Two real detector bugs, caught by testing against real material instead of only synthetic fixtures (this suite's own II.13 discipline) before this ever reached a commit:** the first cut of `capitalization_unguarded` matched only a `.toUpperCase() === …` identity test and missed the actual shape in `corroboration.js`/`hypergraph.js` (`w[0].toUpperCase() + w.slice(1)`, building a capitalised variant for a later comparison, not an inline identity test) — both real-material assertions failed until the pattern gained a `[0].toUpperCase()` alternative. Second: a keyword-proximity "confidence" score (was this capitalisation gate probably already disclosed nearby?) was built, then dropped after `puzzle-templates.js:69`'s undisclosed English-only `AGENT_LIST_RE` scored "probably disclosed" because an unrelated puzzle template's own `giver:` field sat three lines below it — recorded in READING-SPEC.md S116 and in the organ's own header so the same mistake isn't rebuilt later.

fixed: 2 (both caught pre-commit, in this same pass — the capitalisation pattern gap and the confidence-score false positive). struck: the keyword-proximity confidence score (tried, measured against real material, removed).

clean: (all routed lenses reviewed above)

Context: user's question "would a mind transplanted into a universe with different causality struggle?" → run it, not argue it. Result: sentence reversal reads FORWARD at the word grain and reversed-words reads BACKWARD, both chapters — the medium's arrow lives in the words, the referred arrow in the order of what they say; the reader had no Pattern-grain time organ at all before this.

clean: (all routed lenses reviewed above)

Context: the reader now writes EOArrow@1 into every ledger with the rest of the book as its habit — forward, sentence-reversed and shuffled read FORWARD, reversed-words reads BACKWARD, both chapters. Partee's walk binds every regular past tense (0 gaps) and, as its own test predicts, cannot see sentence reversal without a reach-back tense: typing the English pluperfect is the named next step.

| Dijkstra | — | eot-jsonl.mjs (parseWindow … toRaw) | fixed | a REAL bug caught by order-dependence: the ledger's `at` is the origin's coordinate (toRaw) while the parser read the normalised copy — Tom Sawyer forward typed 15 past sentences and reversed 26 until every token offset was mapped through toRaw; now 37/37. Second measurement: a proposition's `at` is its END2 span (181/183), so the verb is located by the ledger's own label, never assumed inside the span |
| Dijkstra | — | clause-tense.js:locateLabel | disclosed | lowercase form-run match for the label — case-folding a token run against the ledger's own label, not identity of anything else |
| Pearl | — | temporal-reference.js:resolveReachBack | no-change | several independent threads each with a prior go to the real `adjudicate`, never "most recent" — same discipline as resolveAnaphoricTense |

THE CEILING, measured: of 7 had-labelled arrangements in Alice ch2, 1 reads Pqp — the perceptron tags "had" as a possessive VERB or the participle as Inf/Fin in the rest (its held-out recall is 74%). Typed coverage 77/183 in Alice ch2 (Past 50, Pres 20, Fut 6, Pqp 1) vs 13/182 before |
clean: (all routed lenses reviewed above)

Context: user — "check for our more universal tense typing, Chomsky." It was there (universal-grammar.js places Tense=Pqp, english-parser.js reads UD feats); this joins them. Partee's walk now has the reach-back, the first order-sensitive move, and its own test shows reversal changing where a Pqp lands. On real chapters every Partee row still sits inside the shuffled range under sentence reversal: too few Pqp survive the parser to move a count. The reader has a referred-time organ now; what it lacks is a tagger that sees the pluperfect.

## 2026-09-25 — Sullivan's second sense: morphology by elimination over seven treebanks, conventions stored with givers, period, region (main, 13 files)

| lens | citation | file:line | verdict | one line |
| Diaconis | II.23 | morph-cues.js (learnFeature) | fixed, three times, each measured | (1) a shuffled-argmax null IS the majority value, so every perfect cue for a majority value tied its own null — Latin Past came back "unreached"; replaced by enrichment of the cue's firing set under shuffled labels. (2) raw excess as the search-floor statistic let a rare perfect Fut ending die at a floor set by the commonest tense; z blew up on one token of a rare value (n=1, p=0.01 → z≈10) and set the floor by flukes — Latin Case coverage fell to 44%; replaced by the exact binomial tail in bits (94.2%). (3) the floor is the best of R null reruns, so the real search beats it ~1/(R+1) of the time: R raised 5→11 and stated in the header; the toy test shows the floor rising with R and killing the fluke |
| Feynman | — | morph-cues.js (lgamma, binomialSurprise) | disclosed | Lanczos g=7 coefficients are the standard table; the log-sum-exp stop (1e-12 relative) is a numeric tolerance, not a decision threshold; p=0 gets a Laplace 1/(n+1) so a value absent from the base cannot be infinitely surprising |
| Dijkstra | — | morph-cues.js (cuesOf), sullivan-morph.mjs (measuredScript) | disclosed | forms case-folded for cue keys (identity of a mark, not of a referent); script measured by Unicode block ranges, a declared table, reported with its share |
| Holmes | — | morph-cues.js (cueKey) | clean | a cue is (kind, key, class) — two forms are one cue only when all three agree; no alias merge |
| Pearl | — | morph-cues.js (split-half) | clean | the two halves are disjoint sentences, so a candidate's agreement across them is two witnesses, not one counted twice |
| Alexander | — | morph-cues.js (predict) | disclosed | cues compose by the most accurate firing cue; disagreement lands typed as contested with the rivals beside it, never averaged or silently resolved |
| Kondo | — | morph-cues.js | fixed | the unused UNIVERSAL_VALUES export removed; the priors store the convention, not the search log — refused lists stay in results/sullivan-morph.json (English prior 13.6 MB → 2.1 MB) |
| Simon/Chekhov | — | morph-cues.js, sullivan-morph.mjs, capacities.js | disclosed | tested on a toy language whose marks are known (case on the ending, tense on the auxiliary AND on its absence, participles carrying Case in a class whose finite forms carry none, one noise feature); exercised on seven real treebanks; registered in capacities.js (EVA·Paradigm) with arrow (CON·Network), narrative-time (REC·Atmosphere), clause-tense (EVA·Lens) — the registry was dirty from another session until now |
| Marshall | — | morph-cues.js (morphCuesFromPrior) | clean | a stored convention is REFUSED without giver, period, region, register, script, license and source, each with its basis (measured from the file / declared from the documentation / declared by the builder — verify); the loader's own refusal runs before any prior is written |
clean: (all routed lenses reviewed above)

Context: user — "we must learn all tenses, cases, etc. Bring Annie Sullivan in here" and "be sure our language conventions are stored with givens and the period and regional provenance". Seven treebanks (English EWT, Latin Perseus, Greek PROIEL, Vedic and UFAL Sanskrit, Arabic PADT, Hebrew HTB), every feature, learned on one half and audited on the other. English Tense 90.1% covered at 97.8%; Latin reaches Past/Pres/Fut/Pqp by form; Greek all four; Vedic no Pqp (measured, kept); Arabic carries no Tense feature (Aspect+Mood instead); Hebrew Past and Fut. Provenance per prior: source sha256, script and document sources measured from the file; giver, period, region, register from the README where one ships (Latin, both Sanskrits) else declared by the builder and marked verify (Greek, Arabic, Hebrew).

| Pearl | — | clause-tense.js (tenseOfClause) | fixed | REAL: the parser's lexicon and Sullivan's cues were both learned from UD_English-EWT, so "corroborated" was two readers of one giver agreeing — now every corroboration and contest carries `independent`, false whenever the witness names PARSER_TREEBANK; an independent second giver (a non-EWT English treebank) is the named next step |
| Frankfurt | — | eot-jsonl.mjs (witnessTally.giver) | disclosed | null when no prior is on disk, and the giver line says "no Sullivan witness" rather than leaving a blank that reads as a value |
| Greenberg | — | eot-jsonl.mjs (LANG === "eng") | disclosed | the witness is English-only because only the English read has UPOS rows to feed cuesOf; Sullivan's Latin, Greek, Hebrew priors exist and wait on a class source for those reads |
| Simon/Chekhov | — | eot-jsonl.mjs, transplant-arm.mjs | disclosed | clause-tense's witness path tested with a stub (fill / corroborate / contest / unmarked / void / no token) and with the real English prior through the refusing loader; eot-jsonl exercised on Alice ch2 × 7 arms |

Context: user — "commit to gh main AFTER you wire". Measured on Alice ch2: Sullivan filled 6 finite arrangements the parser left undeclared (Past 50→54, Pres 20→22, undeclared 106→99), corroborated 10, contested 0, held across every arm. The parser stays the primary giver; the witness never overrides it.

| Holmes | — | pos-rows.js (dominantUpos) | disclosed | a form's class is its type-level majority UPOS in the received prior, so a homograph gets the majority class every time — the occurrence-level grain Sullivan's first sense already names as open; a form the prior never saw gets the empty class and no class-conditioned cue can fire (Void, not a guess) |
| Pearl | — | eot-jsonl.mjs (non-English branch) | disclosed | one witness only — no parser to corroborate or contest — and the class source (pos-heb.json, HTB train) and the cues (morph-cues-he.json, HTB test half) share a treebank, so no independent corroboration is possible for these languages yet |
| Dijkstra | — | pos-rows.js (TOKEN, dominantUpos) | disclosed | tokens are \p{L}\p{N} runs plus the apostrophe family and Hebrew geresh/gershayim; the prior is looked up lowercased then exact; offsets mapped through the caller's map (toRaw) — the same address lesson clause-tense learned |
| Ostrom | — | eot-jsonl.mjs (GIVER strings) | clean | an absent convention says "no learned convention is declared for this language and stage", never "this language has no tense"; I Kings' 0 arrangements is the chapter detector's, and the ledger says so by its own counts |
| Alexander | — | clause-tense.js × pos-rows.js | disclosed | clauseTense over feature-less rows: its English rules cannot fire (no VerbForm/Tense feats), so only the witness speaks — the seam is the one designed, not an accident, and every filled tense names Sullivan and the cue |
| Feynman | — | pos-rows.js | clean | no constants: tie-break lexical, map default identity |
| Kondo | — | sullivan-morph.mjs | fixed | every "declared by the builder — verify" that a README could answer is gone; the four that remain (Greek region, Arabic outlets' cities, Hebrew dates and country) each say the README is silent |
| Simon/Chekhov | — | pos-rows.js, eot-jsonl.mjs, sullivan-morph.mjs | disclosed | pos-rows tested on the real Hebrew prior; eot-jsonl exercised on the modern-Hebrew UDHR (17/54 arrangements typed — Past 10, Fut 7 — 10 times, 10 bound) and on Biblical I Kings (0 arrangements: detector); grc/ar/he priors regenerated with README provenance, cues byte-identical, only provenance lines changed (20–28 lines each) |

Context: user — "make it more just a series of rows, this is overdesigned", then "falsify that this works and improves reasoning". Works held (9/9, 6/6 breaks caught). Improves reasoning did not: no-checker readers 30/36 vs rows 25/36, and on minimal-edit false twins the verdicts are chance (4/6 checkmarks on each side).

| Diaconis | — | sullivan-morph.mjs (PUD), morph-cues.js (periodOverlap) | disclosed | PUD's Features are AUTOMATIC per its README, so its Tense convention (87.1% covered, 95.4% on its own audit half) is learned from a tagger's features, not gold — written into the prior's provenance.features and onto every giver line; the period comparison is a fact only when both sides declare a span, null otherwise |
| Frankfurt | — | sullivan-morph.mjs (SPANS) | disclosed | every builder-dated span (Latin, Greek, both Sanskrits, Hebrew, PUD) carries basis "declared by the builder — verify" and a note naming what the README does and does not say; EWT (2003–2006) and PADT (2001–2004) spans are measured from their own document ids |
| Ostrom | — | clause-tense.js (periodMismatch) | clean | an undeclared period on either side is null — "cannot compare", never "mismatch"; a mismatch is disclosed on the filled tense and counted, and the read proceeds (additive rule) |
| Alexander | — | eot-jsonl.mjs (witnesses order) | disclosed | witnesses are consulted in declared order (EWT, then PUD): the order decides who FILLS an undeclared clause, not what is corroborated or contested; the order is on the giver line |
| Holmes | — | clause-tense.js (treebanksIn) | disclosed | two givers are the same source when their names share a UD_<Lang>-<Treebank> id — mechanical on the strings both carry; a giver naming no treebank (a stub) reads as independent, as the test says |
| Kondo | — | clause-tense.js | clean | the single-witness form ({ witness }) is kept as sugar over the list; nothing dead |

clean: (all routed lenses reviewed above)

Context: user — "keep going." The two levers named in the previous entry: a --period= vs convention-span gate (disclosure, never a block) and an independent second English giver. EWT's own README is still not shipped (its features basis reads "not on record") — the next small fetch. The honest state after this: every English read of a 19th-century text is now told its conventions are a century and a half younger; a period-appropriate English giver does not exist in UD and would have to be built.

The builder now takes a sixth argument or reads the LICENSE.txt beside its input (licenseOf, on the file's own words) or says "unknown"; pos-grc/heb/arb.json corrected in place with the correction and its giver written into their provenance; pos-lat.json built fresh with the right one |
| Dijkstra | — | scripts/build-pos-prior.mjs (licenseOf) | disclosed | a licence name wrapped at a hyphen across lines ("Attribution-NonCommercial-\nShareAlike") is re-joined before matching — measured on PROIEL's and Perseus's files, which both wrap there; long and short CC forms handled, anything else null |
| Greenberg | Allen & Greenough §§144, 146 | eot-jsonl.mjs (LANG_PRONOUNS.lat) | disclosed | the Latin third-person set is a giver-named closed class (is/hic/ille/iste, the reflexive), short because Latin is pro-drop — the language's own typology, not under-listing; the Latin convention maps by stage (Classical/Augustan, -63..405) |
| Pearl | — | eot-jsonl.mjs (Latin) | disclosed | one witness, class source and cues from one treebank — no corroboration possible for Latin yet, same as Hebrew |

| Kondo | — | — | clean | nothing dead; the critique rerun (archon-holocracy 03774b6) shows the day's passes added organs, evals and priors but no law entries — the drill-into-policy debt is named, not paid, here |

The Latin transplant held on every row. Honest state: Latin runs; the referred-time organ has still not moved on any text |
clean: (all routed lenses reviewed above)

Context: user — "keep going" (Latin first), then "be sure that our competency in ANYTHING can help us comprehend ANYTHING regardless of modality." The Latin result says the same thing the English one did: text keeps failing to show the reach-back moving. The next entry takes the organs, unmodified, to code and MIDI.

clean: (all routed lenses reviewed above)

Context: user — "be sure that our competency in ANYTHING can help us comprehend ANYTHING regardless of modality." Text never moved the referred-time organ under reversal (English, Hebrew, Latin: three "held"). In code, on every file, both rows are outside every shuffled draw — arrow.js bound 146→53 (shuffled 81–105), gaps 25→118 (66–90); temporal-reference.js 66→28 / 19→57; morph-cues.js 522→267 / 108→363 — and reversal is worse than disorder, because every use is then before its definition. The arrow organ reads code as it reads text (forward/backward/null). Music: irreversible at the interval grain, but Hume's habit does not cross works there; a grain where it might (contour, duration, pitch-class) is the named next probe. Drill-into-policy debt named: today's proven fixes live in this log and in tests, not yet as S-entries.

clean: (all routed lenses reviewed above)

Context: user — decide before changing behaviour ("a change moves live readings"), then chose per-shape seeding, (ge + 1) / (draws + 1), and 200 draws at the declared 0.05. The reach was narrower than feared: one production caller (learn-pass.js's population ground) and three eval drivers. Nothing stable moved (0 of 1,270); every change lands on the 283 of 1,553 documents that were already run-dependent. Built on branch segment-seed (worktree eoreader7-segment-seed).

## 2026-09-29 — five failures on a pristine main: the stranded `what` row restored, the native/tests/ copy tree retired (test-repair-2026-09-29, 2 commits)

clean: (all routed lenses reviewed above)

Context: user — fix five tests failing on a pristine main (73639c5): `organs/what.test.mjs` and four `native/tests/conformance/` files failing at import. The row was never committed on any ref; it was in stash@{0} (2026-09-23, 45 files, never popped — the anchors/thea rows and the what/anchors organs' drafted Reading-Spec entries are still there, untouched). The four were copies: `native/tests/{conformance,kernel,text}/` duplicated conformance/, kernel/ and adapters/text/ (swept in by the 14dc2c5 checkpoint; `tests/kernel/self.js` is `kernel/self.js` as of 0b0c94d), 33 of the 35 copied tests failing while their canonical originals pass. Unique content was ported before removal; two source pieces that exist nowhere else went to STASH.md at 14dc2c5, not into the tree. New guard `conformance/tests-boundary.test.mjs` was seen failing on the copy tree (111 modules, 30 tests) and passing after; its first version misread fixture strings in code-hunk/code-scan as imports until anchored — CODING-LESSONS §79. The native-suite delta also includes a LIVE gemma2:2b witness passing after failing: environmental (depends on the local model), not this diff. Tooling note: chorus-fast's routing pointer undercounts line numbers by the blank added lines above a hit (its awk counts only non-empty `+` lines) — it reported CODING-LESSONS.md:1973 for line 1977.

## 2026-10-01 — chase: whole-codebase ground wired into /v1/code (`ground:true`) and aimed at a real GH code stack (bare-metal-eo-matrix-app)
- **Wired and live:** `/v1/code` now ingests the whole workspace via `openFolder` (territory, model-free) before the loop; round 1 renders the task-resolved files + the top file's real bytes (renderTerritoryGround, Gary-safe — no apparatus names). Measured live: "code ground → whole-workspace territory indexed: 63 files in 27–202 ms".
- **The target:** the bare-metal app's own suite had 5 real pre-existing failures — WORKDAY/DAY build UTC-midnight dates but read the weekday in local time, so on this box (west of UTC) a Friday reads as Thursday and the step lands on Saturday. Scoped real gate `test-workday.cjs` fails red (3 of 7).
- **Blocked, honestly:** the live end-to-end draw could not get a code-loop slot — heimdall's family lane persistently `not_your_turn` (position #2, workAhead 4–5) behind other work on this shared box; chat probes passed while the code loop sat. The earlier ungrounded run (old proxy) had already shown gemma2:2b hallucinating `solution.py` even with real files listed. Two independent constraints stand: the only resident mouth (2b) is below the bar for a UTC/local-date fix, and the 8b reasoning mouth cannot load under memory pressure.
- **Learning:** the pre-model SEG is necessary but not sufficient when the mouth is below the bar — the loop's gates still refuse rather than corrupt (no disk touched, stuck verdict, disclosed). The full-codebase-edit chase needs the located slot (SEG) + a mouth that can draw a real patch (8b+) on a quieter box.

## 2026-10-01 — making the coding system smarter than the models (Gary's levers, chase session 2)
Measured live against the bare-metal app with the only resident mouth (gemma2:2b): the model, shown a located file, STILL emitted `PATH: solution.py` — it imitates the taught `PATH: file` shape over any instruction. The system fix is to make the wrong move structurally impossible, not to prompt better:
1. **Path-less located mode** — when the territory SEG has located the file, the proposal grammar has no PATH field; any other explicit path is the typed gap `unexpected_path`, never a hunt for a real one. Live: `solution.py` disappeared entirely.
2. **No reads in located mode** — the located file's real bytes are fully shown; a read is `unexpected_read` (live: the mouth read real names with wrong prefixes instead of editing).
3. **Source-first SEG** — the task's literal expectations ranked the test file above the implementation (test/formula.test.cjs 67.6 > public/formula.js 64.4); the located file now prefers a source file over a test/doc.
4. **Scoped fold** — when located, the fold covers ONLY the located file's declarations (the slot view); on the 63-file fold a 2b mouth degraded to echoing its own model name.
5. **Full chain unit-proven**: a path-less patch resolves to the located file, applies, runs the real declared test, passes, and attributes `figureOp: "DEF"` (the fold's slot-level operator).
The residual wall is the mouth: the 2b can no longer hallucinate a path (attractor closed) but still cannot emit the exact path-less FIND/ADD bytes; the 8b reasoning mouth cannot load under memory pressure, and the box is shared with penelope (`apps/weaves`) so the live loop's turn was held to the deadline. The machinery is complete; a live full-codebase edit now needs only a mouth that can generate the bytes.

## 2026-10-01 — Sullivan's fourth sense, identity-shaped: the correspondence is a QUESTION ABOUT BEING, adjudicated FOR-WHOM over the RELATION universe — never a byte rewrite (main, 5 files)
- **The correction.** The first spelling-correspondence build rewrote bytes ("hee"→"he") before the parser read — a byte identity nobody adjudicated. The house's identity law (identity-induction.js, for-whom.js, S113) says a literal span is a witness, never identity; two surfaces are one being only when the universe folded on them is the same, bounded by a difference that makes a difference, ALWAYS for a for-whom. The organ now emits identity hypotheses (identityAlternative on the fold) instead of rewrites.
- **Relations, not co-appearance.** The swarm's own finding: co-arrival "collapsed exactly on same-scene companions" (Наташа/Соня). The identity record is built from HYPEREDGES — what a being is end1/end2 OF, at byte offsets (`relationRecordOf`) — never from the words that sit beside it. Things do not just co-appear; they relate in certain ways.
- **Wired.** `native/adapters/text/spelling-correspondence.js` (learnCorrespondence distribution + `relationRecordOf` + `judgeIdentity` through identity-induction's four tests, identity-verdict, for-whom); `native/eval/lavar/spelling-correspondence.mjs` (identity section: real Folio↔modern pairs adjudicated for-whom, shuffled mispair control); `native/eval/english/read-english.mjs` (`spellingIdentityRead` — original bytes kept, hypotheses carried with byte spans, offsets reproduce the source); `native/priors/spelling-early-modern-en.json` (the learned convention).
- **Falsified.** On real Henry IV Folio↔modern: the identity law binds genuine spelling variants (vpon~upon, iohn~john) and the shuffled mispair control binds 0 — a mispair is never fused. On ROT13 Hamlet: cipher `unzyrg`↔plain `hamlet` adjudicated over the relation universe, control (cipher ~ random OTHER referent) binds 0 of 26. `read-english` on the cipher reads 68.5% unseen forms (lexicon destroyed) vs 13.2% recovered; referent discovery on the cipher admits the ROT13'd names (Unzyrg, Pynhqvhf Xvat) and on the recovered text the true Hamlet cast.
- **Disclosed wall.** The reader's RELATION extraction on dense verse is thin (the paraphrase wall) — most adjudicated pairs read "idle"/"not_enough_reading", an honest typed gap, never a guess. The identity law is sound; the relations it folds are only as many as the reader heard.

## 2026-10-01 — organic priors falsification: relation universe on real human chat, born-referent-keyed (main, 2 files)
- **The test.** Newly pushed `live_priors/19-organic-community/` — nus-sms (Singlish+typos "K:-)ya i hav to finish"), cosem (Singapore English "Extracted tqo", "Ps eat Liao!"), enron workplace email, ubuntu-irc (en/de/es/it), lccc Weibo. Chomsky's parser degrades honestly: nus-sms 25.2% unseen, cosem 19.2%, ubuntu-irc-en 18%, ubuntu-irc-de 59.7%, lccc-zh 84% (trained on 2000s web English).
- **Born referents, never surfaces (the correction the test forced).** `relationRecordOf` re-keyed unstamped participants by their surface — S113's violation in a new coat. Fixed: the nodes are ONLY the fold's own `EOReferent@1` born ids; a participant points at a node through its stamped `ref` or is a witness without a node. Measured on an IRC channel-day: 185 born, 4032 stamped participants all pointing at born ids, 24,486 unstamped excluded.
- **Falsified.** Relation universe adjudicated for-whom over 4 registers: enron 0 bound/21 unbound + control 0/28 ✓; cosem 0/3 + 0/18 ✓; ubuntu-irc-en 4/41 + 0/30 ✓; ubuntu-irc-de 1/44 + **1/28 control wrongly bound ✗**.
- **The caught defect (the falsification's point).** German IRC fused `jokrebel ~ geser` — two distinct active helpers whose relation universes overlap on a single channel-day's shared support vocabulary (`> ... <` quote prefixes, `dankeschön`, `ssh`, `per ... <`). The four tests read them as one being because the companion collapse the swarm predicted (co-arrival on same-scene companions, Наташа/Соня) reproduces at the RELATION level when the relation universe is one channel-day thick. The law caught itself; the defect is now named — a for-whom whose frame is a single channel-day cannot distinguish two helpers who do the same things in the same channel. The fix direction is the one the law already names: the frame must widen (a for-whom that spans channel-days, or the DMD trajectory bound over reading time, which a same-day universe cannot supply).
- **10/10 organ tests pass**, including born-referent-keyed relationRecordOf and the cross-read identity pin.

## 2026-10-01 — the baby-learning theory, falsified-and-confirmed: learn the organic register from itself (main, 4 files)
- **The theory (user):** "people learn this type of speech far sooner and more easily than proper grammar." Testable consequence: the organic register's own constructions, learned from the register by co-occurrence above its own null, should read the register BETTER than the baseline perceiver or the good-books transfer (hand-typed formal clause shapes). Wittgenstein: meaning is use — the reader that actually reads wins.
- **Built:** `native/scripts/build-fragment-construction-prior.mjs` — ConstructionPrior@2 learned from live_priors/19-organic-community/ (297 docs, 272,807 sentences, 2.95M tokens): an OPEN (rare) form's tier conditioned on the following token's tier, admitted above the register's own shuffled-label null (47,830 cells dropped as below it — the material refuses what it does not warrant). The baby's received grammar: OPEN forms that reliably precede a closed-class token ("eat Liao") are its relational heads.
- **Falsified, three conditions, same material:** nus-sms with-relations baseline 2 / good-books transfer 5 / **baby 11**; cosem 4 / 10 / **12**; enron 15 / 18 / **29**. And the control: the good-books transfer fused 1 mispair on enron (1/22); the baby bound 0/23 on every register — denser AND sounder.
- **The decision (do what works):** the register-learned grammar stays the reading's floor for organic material. The good-books transfer helps (it raised cosem 4→10) and is kept as a second seam, but the register's own grammar is what reads the register — confirming the theory on the material that matters.
- **The seam it closes:** `fragmentRelations` (adapters/text/fragment-relations.js) wired into the perceiver with a `fragmentSeam` lever (default on), and the falsification harness `native/eval/lavar/falsify-baby-theory.mjs` reproducing the three-way comparison.

## 2026-10-01 — the shape transfers: the same learner learns code dialects from code, not just speech from SMS (main, 3 files)
- **The question (user):** "is this teaching us general lessons about how to learn any language content (or any content that has latent structure)?" The answer is only a fact if the SAME learner shape holds in another medium. Code is the test.
- **The transfer:** `native/eval/lavar/learn-code-dialects.mjs` — the identical construction-learning shape (OPEN atom's tier conditioned on the following atom's tier, admitted above the material's own shuffled null) applied to source code's own atoms (keywords/operators/identifiers/literals), not to words. `native/eval/lavar/lib/dialect-corpus.mjs` — the medium-blind corpus walker.
- **Proven on live_priors/09-source-code/:** git_git (C) learns 175 closed types, 99 cells above its own null (1040 refused), heads `refs_for_each_cb`/`old_refs`/`to_buf`; python_cpython learns 242 closed types, 131 cells (1308 refused), heads `get_args`/`point2d`/`callable_o`/`pyerr_occurred`/`missing_names`. The `pyerr_occurred` head is a real CPython error-check idiom the learner discovered as a construction purely from co-occurrence — the same way it discovered Singlish particles.
- **The general lesson (stated as the law this chase earned):**
  1. structure is latent, learned from the material's own co-occurrence, never received from a "proper" source — there is no proper source, only neighborhoods;
  2. every admission is tested against the material's own null;
  3. "degradation" is only distance between neighborhoods, never a property of the material;
  4. identity is for-whom, relative, over structure — never over surface;
  5. falsification is the method: a reading is sound only when the thing that must not bind, doesn't.
- **The shape is medium-blind:** the kernel files already say "no word, no sentence, no verb"; the dialect learners add "no token, no atom" — the corpus walker, the tokenizer, and the conditional/null machinery are the medium's own decisions, and the algorithm is the same.

## 2026-10-01 — the arrow of time is per-dialect and per-level; the learner must detect it, never assume it (main, 2 files)
- **The law (user):** "some dialects care about the arrow of time and some don't, and in different ways." The construction learner conditions OPEN→next-token, which ASSUMES a left-to-right arrow. The probe (`native/eval/lavar/arrow-probe.mjs`) detects the arrow per dialect: build construction cells in-order, line-shuffled, and token-shuffled; the survival curve IS the arrow's shape.
- **Measured on six registers:**
  | material | line-shuffle survives | token-shuffle survives | doc-arrow |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Alice (narrative) | 99% | 69% | arrowed 45% |
  | NASA catalog | 97% | 29% | arrowed 71% |
  | cosem (chat) | 93% | 63% | arrowed 51% |
  | enron (email) | 101% | 37% | **flat 23%** |
  | git (C) | 106% | 52% | arrowed 41% |
  | python | 97% | 58% | arrowed 45% |
- **What the probe teaches:** the construction arrow lives almost universally WITHIN the line (token level) — every dialect loses cells under token-shuffle, nearly none under line-shuffle. The degree differs: rigid field syntax (catalog 29%, email 37%) has the strongest token arrow; clause-rich grammar (prose 69%, chat 63%) the weakest. Line order is free in every dialect. The DOCUMENT arrow is where narrative/code/chat "go somewhere" — and enron is the falsifying control (a bag of unrelated messages, flat 23%), proving the measure discriminates the arrow's real seat.
- **The correction it forces:** a learner should condition on the level where the arrow lives for ITS dialect — the construction prior should ask "is this a bag, an arrow, or a loop?" first, then choose its conditioning variable. One unconditional next-token assumption is the same mistake as assuming one "proper" grammar.
- **Honest caveat:** the NASA "arrowed 71%" doc-drift is partly a measurement artifact (a growing list's first entry vs last entry differ in vocabulary without "going somewhere" like a plot); the doc-drift is a coarse first probe, not the final word on the document arrow.

## 2026-10-01 — the full dialect run: every register's own grammar with its own measured arrow, identity falsified across all (main, 4 files)
- **The arrow, measured and carried on every prior (2026-10-01).** `learnDialect` now returns `arrow` (`DialectArrow@1`): token-survival (share of cells surviving within-unit token shuffle — low = order carries structure), line-survival (unit order — near 1 everywhere = unit order is free in every dialect), docDrift (first/last-half vocabulary drift). Measured: enron token-surv 0.28 (rigid email form, strongest token arrow) · cosem 0.64 (loose Singlish) · irc-en 0.58 · lccc-zh 0.59 · irc-de 0.37 · nus-sms-en 0.56 · irc-it 0.36 · irc-es 0.44 · nus-sms-zh (0 cells — the whole prior is a bag). Line-surv 0.90–1.11 everywhere. DocDrift: enron flat 0.23 (a bag of messages), the rest arrowed 0.51–0.60.
- **The lesson confirmed:** some dialects care about the arrow of time and some don't, and in different ways — but the construction arrow lives WITHIN the unit (token level) in every dialect, while unit order is free everywhere. A learner that conditions on next-token is right where the arrow is strongest for rigid-form dialects (enron, irc-it) and slightly wrong for the bag-like ones (cosem). The prior now discloses its own arrow so the consumer can weight the conditioning.
- **Full identity falsification** (`native/eval/lavar/dialect-identity-falsify.mjs`): every dialect read with its OWN grammar, identity for-whom over the relation universe. nus-sms 0/8 ✓ · cosem 0/12 ✓ · enron 0/17 ✓ · irc-de 0/17 ✓ · **irc-en 1/20 ✗** — the companion-collapse again: on one dense channel-day two active participants' relation universes genuinely fold close. The law caught itself across 4 of 5 registers and named the one where the frame is too thin.
- **The dialect priors** (`native/priors/fragment-construction-<dialect>.json`): 9 dialects, each learned from itself, each carrying its own null, its own arrow, its own heads. IRC-en is the largest (161,970 sentences, 8,514 cells).
## 2026-09-30 — the screenshot reader brought into the pipeline: reading (lookAtImage), generation (page-build style), shell (screenshot-pipeline, 17 paths)
fast: 6 modified + 11 new paths · screen-pipeline 22/22, assembly-registry + earned-constants pass · native suite 2005→2027 tests, the same 43 fail by name as a clean origin/main (0981582), 0 regressions · law: ok (0 citations; dup headers pre-existing: P115 P116 P117 P19 P233 in the-fold/POLICIES.md, S17 S96 here)
FAIL carried, not fixed — identical on a clean origin/main worktree: tests/provenance-feed (5) and tests/single-grain-audit (imports auditSingleGrain, which proxy-runner.mjs never defined); native holodeck-e2e (2) fail on the colony evaluator's `setrlimit` ("current limit exceeds maximum limit") on this host.

| Feynman | II.11 | proxy-runner.mjs:2654 | fixed | a bare `12 * 1024 * 1024` duplicated the workspace scan's own literal; both now read MAX_LOOK_IMAGE_BYTES, named as set by hand. Also: every hand-set constant of the screen core is named with its giver in SCREEN_SETTINGS, and the gate floor (0.77) cites the 12-vs-17 measurement it came from. |
| Feynman | — | native/conformance/screen-pipeline.test.mjs | noted | first mutation pass found two tests that could not fail (the 1x sample hid a dropped unit; noise scores ~0 and cannot pin the gate floor); both strengthened and re-mutated before the entry was written. |
| Dijkstra | — | proxy-runner.mjs:2657 | false-positive-on-review | `extname(name).toLowerCase()` is reached only after isImageFileName(name) (a closed extension set), and names a temp file inside an mkdtemp dir that is removed in `finally`; the name is never used as a path. |
| Alexander | — | native/eval/results/assembly-reconstruction.json:408 | false-positive-on-review | the hit is the added A2.1 row for eval/results/screen-roundtrip.md (a typed no_registered_boundary gap, naming its organs); no composition gate was touched. |
| Greenberg | — | native/organs/look.js | clean | `node native/organs/greenberg.js native/organs/look.js` returns {}; the edit is a third sense in lookAtImage, no grammar field or language default. |
clean: Simon/Chekhov (not routed — every new source file is imported by screen-pipeline.test.mjs), Frankfurt (not routed).

Context: user — "bring it fully into the pipeline for normal use in generation and/or reading" (PR #144's tool). Not done on purpose, stated in native/docs/SCREENSHOT-PIPELINE.md: HTTP chat still drops base64 attachments (parseProxyRequest keeps only {name, text}); the notebook door still ingests images by flat OCR.

## 2026-10-03 — the coding loop's first frontier run, error-corrected: the test's own failure locates the missing unit, a draw's material is never dropped by the prompt budget, fenced reads are absorbed, and the two hunts split (branch main, staged diff, 5 files)
fast: 5 files (4 modified + 1 new) · tests 55→49/55, native 203→200/203, all 9 failures verified identical by name on the same tree with the staged changes reverted (feed ×5, single-grain-audit, holodeck-e2e ×2 incl. the /analyze production door, requireReasoning/reason.mjs UNREAD — the last two carried in earlier entries too) · law: ok (0 citations; pre-existing dup headers S17 S96 carried)

| Feynman | — | CODING-LESSONS.md:2543 | clean | the routed line is lesson prose citing code-loop.js:883->958 (the void loop's single-declaration prompt), not a code constant; the claim carries its measurement and falsifying control. |
| Dijkstra | — | native/the-fold/code-hunt.js:27 | false-positive-on-review | SKIP_DIRS is the workspace walk's directory skip set (build/VCS dirs), not identity or locale logic; nothing hashes or lowercases a key here. |

| Frankfurt | — | CODING-LESSONS.md:2455 | clean | the routed line quotes a fabricated example INSIDE lesson 92 (what a small model invented); the lesson's guard is what the diff records. |
| Greenberg | — | native/the-fold/code-hunt.js:35 | fixed | `toLowerCase().match(/[a-z][a-z-]{2,}/g)` is a Latin-script tokenizer; the split made it newly visible, so specFrameWords now declares its script scope in-place: ASCII identifiers are the hunt's languages, and a non-Latin spec degrades to an EMPTY frame (typed absence), never a wrong match. |
| Kondo | — | CODING-LESSONS.md:2519 | clean | lesson prose; the mechanical sweep (kondo.mjs scan) named no staged path — code-hunt.js is wired (code-loop.js:42 imports, 5 call sites). |
| Simon/Chekhov | — | native/the-fold/code-hunt.js | noted | the chorus note "no test file imports" is true and expected: the module is an internal dependency of code-loop.js, exercised indirectly by the code-loop suite (32/33, the 1 pre-existing) and the void-loop suite (50/50); the split is a pure move of the draft's hunt.js, byte-identical content. |
clean: Feynman, Holmes, Frankfurt, Kondo (routed, nothing to report beyond the lines above).

Context: user — "fix it so the tasks work. use this as error correction to develop a better system in general", after the live token-saving test. The staged diff is the error correction: locateMissingUnit + preflight (green = zero draws), fenced-read absorption, prompt budget follows the window + drawOnly material kept whole, and the hunt.js split (code-hunt.js new, essay hunt restored — pipeline-run.mjs and both falsify suites green again: 41/41). Lessons 98–101 recorded in CODING-LESSONS.md. Live verification: /v1/code with claude-sonnet-4-5 on the heimdall workspace, done in 1 round, 3/3 tests green, 14,991 in / 865 out vs 78,081 in / 600 out for the raw-dump baseline.
