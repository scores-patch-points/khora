// swarm-server.mjs — the chat wire-up for capacity-swarm.
//
// NL in a chat names the pointing; this module does the rest with the REAL
// organs (never stubs): makeCapacityRunner over cast.js's makeReferentIndex
// + reader-bundle.js's engineRelationsFor, the same reader the proxy turn
// feeds its own reading surface from. No model call, no hand-set threshold:
// the bar is measured per turn (seed-best yield rerun RERUN_NULL.draws
// times through elenchusBar — deterministic yields collapse it to epsilon,
// a measured nonzero floor would be honored).
//
// Entry points:
//   runSwarmTurn({ task, texts, history, name, query, claim, force })
//     task    — the raw NL chat string (the pointing)
//     texts   — [{ name, text }] material the person pointed at
//               (attachments; absent material yields 0 everywhere and the
//               gate honestly refuses it all)
//     history — [{ name, text }] the conversation's prior turns: read by
//               a swarm the NL or `force` routed, NEVER by the hard-meaning
//               trigger (prior answers' citation marks are not garble)
//     force   — true from the explicit POST /v1/swarm endpoint (run the
//               pointing even when the auto-route phrasing is absent);
//               false from the chat auto-route (only swarm phrasing routes)
// Returns a JSON-safe report (no functions, no Maps) + `answer` prose.
