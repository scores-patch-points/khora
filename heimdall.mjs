// heimdall.mjs — the watcher at Bifröst who keeps every surface alive and
// steers traffic across them, on a DEF → EVA → REC loop.
//
// Handle: Heimdall — the god who stands at Bifröst and watches. He sees and
// hears everything, keeps watch against the day the bridge fails, and sounds
// the horn when danger comes. Here the bridge is the local model's SURFACES:
// every proxy process that fronts Ollama. Heimdall watches each one, re-forges
// the dead ones, and steers each request across the healthy ones.
//
// Huginn, Muninn and Kairos (eoreader7/native/organs/huginn.js, muninn.js, kairos.js) are
// his three — the triad under the bridge. Huginn is the watcher of model
// PRIORITIZATION — which model answers which job, ranked by measured
// evidence and hopped on typed failure, room mouths included. Muninn is
// the watcher of MEMORY — what is recalled into the turn from the record,
// and what earns standing, never a word of it replacing the record's own
// bytes. Kairos is the watcher of the PATTERN — whether the turn's
// difference made a difference, the sign (pattern / noise / gap) over the
// aperture's measured surprise and the correspondence acts, never a metric
// displayed and never a verdict from an unmeasured gap. Heimdall is the
// boss: the surfaces, the steering, the admission, the re-forging, and (since
// 2026-09-19) the reaping of background strays stay here; the three answer
// only under the bridge. The register lives in
// the-fold's solon.js — the one authoritative list, never restated here.
//
// The loop, in this system's own act vocabulary:
//   DEF  — declare the void: every surface watched, and a suspected breakdown.
//   EVA  — evaluate: actually probe each surface, get a verdict.
//   REC  — re-zero: concede the failing ground and re-forge it (restart),
//          with the trigger recorded verbatim. Never a silent restart.
//
// The walls (this project's own law, applied to the watcher):
//   - EVA never convicts on a suspicion; it probes first, and only a
//     measured breakdown reaches REC.
//   - REC is bounded: a restart storm is itself a finding, never a loop.
//   - Steering admits by MODEL FAMILY with a per-family cap and a typed
//     429 + Retry-After refusal; routing across proxies to the SAME Ollama
//     serializes anyway, so the bridge shapes admission, never pretending
//     to spread load that cannot spread.
//   - Every act lands on a log (heimdall-log.jsonl) — append-only while it
//     is fresh, then SNAPSHOT and TRIM (2026-09-19): the memory is not
//     infinite. Recent past stays verbatim (full resolution); past a horizon
//     the raw lines fold into hourly snapshots, then daily, then are
//     released — higher resolution for the more recent past. The learner
//     (the rule-author holon) reads through the fold, so trimming never
//     blinds it.
//
// DUAL MODE (2026-09-13): the watcher now runs INSIDE the proxy. The proxy
// imports this module, starts the watcher, serves /heimdall itself, and
// applies the same admission on its own request path — one process, no
// separate steer port, no second checkout to drift. The module still runs
// STANDALONE (`node heimdall.mjs`) with its own steer server when it is the
// main entry; when imported, it exports its machinery and does not listen.
//
// The registry is env-driven: each surface is `name:port:cwd:cmd`, and the
// restart env is reproduced from the same vars used to launch it.

// ── INFERENCE HOSTS: many small servers, one picker (2026-09-21) ──────────
// Our incentives are not a GPU farm's. The models are small and the box is
// shared, so a turn's cost is not generation throughput — it is the COLD
// LOAD (seconds, and it evicts what was resident) and the PROMPT EVAL (the
// prefix cache only helps on the server that already saw the prefix).
// Measured on this box 2026-09-21: one turn = 7.8s wall, of which prompt
// eval 1.7s, generation 4.4s for 32 tokens, load 10ms because the model
// was resident. A naive round robin across N servers would pay a cold load
// on every server for every model and throw away every prefix cache. So
// the picker is, in order:
//   1. STICKY — a session stays on the host that last served it while that
//      host is up and the model is still resident there (prefix cache, no
//      reload).
//   2. RESIDENT FIRST — among the rest, a host with the model resident
//      (/api/ps, probed each cadence) outranks one that must load it —
//      unless its expected wait exceeds the other's wait plus the load cost
//      MEASURED on that other host (its own load_duration EWMA), never a
//      hand-set constant.
//   3. SHORTEST EXPECTED WAIT — in-flight × measured mean turn ms on that
//      host for that model; unmeasured hosts score at the mean of the
//      measured ones, so they are tried, never starved or preferred.
//   4. ROTATE TIES — an idle fleet spreads instead of pinning the first host.
// A host that refuses (ECONNREFUSED) is stood down until the next cadence
// probes it back; a single timeout never convicts (the last state stands).
// Configure with ER7_OLLAMA_HOSTS="name=http://host:port,name=url"; with no
// override the one on-device host is the bridge (2026-09-28: it replaced the

//     bounds, the act breakdown, vitals min/max/last, and the lesson notes'
//     text all survive; only the verbatim redundancy is returned.
//   - A line that cannot be aged (no parseable `at`) is NEVER folded — it
//     stays raw, because folding it would be guessing its age.
//   - The consolidation is synchronous and atomic (write-tmp-rename), so a
//     live appendLog can never interleave into a half-trimmed log.
//   - A consolidation failure NEVER takes the watcher down; it is skipped
//     and retried next cadence.

// the obvious source does not exist: the Ollama.app writes a parseable
// per-request log (~/.ollama/logs/server.log) but the Homebrew server now
// serving this box writes none, so scraping a log would measure whichever
// install happened to be running — a fact about the log, not about the box.
//
// The numbers already exist at every caller: Ollama returns
// prompt_eval_count/duration, eval_count/duration and load_duration on the
// done chunk of every single call. So a surface REPORTS what it already
// measured (`observeCall`), and the bridge keeps the account: totals per
// model, and an EWMA so a rate follows the box rather than averaging away a
// bad hour. Nothing here spends a model call of its own to find out — a
// watcher that generates load to measure load is the self-defense loop's own
// refuted move.
//
// Measured while building this, and the reason it is worth keeping: gemma2:2b
// answered at 15.8 tok/s on an idle box and averaged 4.4 tok/s across a real
// 4.5-hour working window — the same model, ~3.6x slower under contention.

//   smollm2:1.7b — HANGS on a `system`-role message. The same prompt, with
//     the instruction folded into the `user` turn, writes fluent prose in
//     seconds; with a `system` role it never returns (measured: the call
//     timed out at 90-120s while /api/ps showed the model resident). Its
//     template was trained on user/assistant turns; the system role is a
//     template hallucination, not a feature.
//   hf.co/allenai/OLMo-2-0425-1B-Instruct-GGUF — the HF import loads to a

//     (Heimdall's loadedWindowOf discipline: declare what you need, never
//     let the import's default hang).
//   every small model — the load is paid ONCE; a model resident in /api/ps
//     answers in seconds, but any request asking a DIFFERENT num_ctx than
//     the loaded window forces a full reload (measured 2026-09-15 on

//   - NEVER kill by bare name. A pid dies only on a KNOWN stray signature:
//     an ephemeral `serve.mjs 0` orphan past its grace (ppid 1 — its spawner

//     parent); a server process holding NO listening port at all (it failed
//     to bind but never exited — verified by lsof, never guessed).
//   - NEVER the self, NEVER an ancestor of the self, NEVER pid ≤ 1.
//   - A single instance is never a duplicate — no conviction on a suspicion.
//   - A contested same-port group with no lsof proof is REPORTED, never
//     killed (an unverified probe convicts nothing — the surface rule).
//   - Bounded per act (REAP_MAX_KILLS) and escalating: SIGTERM first, SIGKILL
//     only for a pid that survived a TERM and is still stray on re-sense.

// ── FAST PASS: the ungated lane (2026-09-18) ─────────────────────────────────
// A remote mouth (Anthropic's own API, the opencode server) never touches this
// box: no VRAM, no keep-alive, no reload, no local contention. Gating it on box
// saturation or the local family cap is a category error — a pegged box would
// 429 a call that costs the box nothing. So an ungated model skips the
// saturation check, the family cap, and the head-of-line queue entirely: the
// ration, the servable check, and the exactly-once claim still apply (fairness
// and safety are not bypassed), but the local line never blocks it. The
// admission carries fastPass:true so the proxy skips its local inflight mark
// too — otherwise the remote call would inflate workAhead/ETA and lane-full
// decisions for the local calls behind it.
//

// local gate while it loaded onto this very box. Two rules, in order: a
// model the daemon has installed is ON the device, whatever its name; else a
// model leaves the device only when its id starts with a remote lane's
// prefix (the opencode lane speaks `provider/model`, the Anthropic lane
